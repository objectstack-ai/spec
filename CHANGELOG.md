# Changelog

All notable changes to the ObjectStack Protocol will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **`@objectstack/service-tenant` — system objects now actually register** — `createTenantPlugin()` previously declared its control-plane schemas (`sys_project`, `sys_project_credential`, `sys_project_member`, `sys_package`, `sys_package_version`, `sys_package_installation`, `sys_tenant_database`) via a top-level `objects: [...]` field on the kernel plugin object. The kernel only consumes `plugin.objects` for **nested** plugins inside a parent manifest (`packages/objectql/src/engine.ts` → `registerPlugin()`), so plugins added via `kernel.use(plugin)` had to use the `manifest` service (as `AuthPlugin`/`SecurityPlugin`/`SetupPlugin` already do). The result was that `sys__project` etc. were never registered with `SchemaRegistry`, so `ObjectQL.getDriver('sys__project')` could not match the `namespace: 'sys' → turso` `datasourceMapping` rule (the lookup returned `undefined` and skipped past the namespace check), silently routing every control-plane write to the default driver — typically the in-memory driver. On Vercel each lambda instance has its own memory, so `POST /api/v1/cloud/projects` "succeeded" with HTTP 202 but the row evaporated on cold start, causing the subsequent `GET /api/v1/cloud/projects/:id` to return 404 even though the user/organization writes (registered through the proper path by `AuthPlugin`) were correctly persisted in Turso. The plugin now registers the same set of objects via `ctx.getService('manifest').register({ id: 'com.objectstack.tenant', namespace: 'sys', objects: [...] })` and throws if the manifest service is unavailable, fail-fast instead of silent data loss. Also affected: package install/upgrade endpoints, project credential rotation, project membership reads.

### Changed
- **`examples/app-crm` — showcase `fieldGroups` MVP** — The CRM reference example (`Account`, `Contact`, `Opportunity`, `Lead`) now demonstrates the new `fieldGroups` protocol end to end. Each object declares logical groups (e.g., *Basic Information*, *Financials*, *Contact Information*, *Ownership & Status*, *System*) and every field opts in via `group: '<key>'`. No business logic changed — only field-layout metadata — so existing validations, workflows, indexes, and state machines are unaffected. Useful as a reference when designing multi-group forms and detail pages.

### Added
- **Field Groups (`fieldGroups`) — simplified MVP protocol** — Introduced a data-layer protocol for grouping fields on an object in forms, detail pages, and editors. Designed to be AI-generation- and extension-friendly by intentionally minimizing surface area:
  - New `ObjectFieldGroupSchema` in `packages/spec/src/data/object.zod.ts` with `key` (snake_case machine key), `label`, optional `icon`, `description`, `defaultExpanded` (default `true`), and `visibleOn` (expression for conditional visibility). No `order` property — **array declaration order is the display order**.
  - `ObjectSchema` gains an optional `fieldGroups: ObjectFieldGroup[]`. Group keys are validated to be unique within an object.
  - The existing `Field.group: string` property on `FieldSchema` is the sole field→group assignment mechanism. Field → group mapping is derived automatically from metadata registration; in-group display order equals the traversal order of `ObjectSchema.fields`. Extension packages and runtime code use `Field.group` uniformly.
  - Supported migrations at this layer: add / rename / delete / reorder groups (by editing the `fieldGroups` array) and assigning an existing field to a group (by editing `Field.group`). Explicit per-field in-group ordering is deferred to a future iteration.
  - New `ObjectFieldGroup` / `ObjectFieldGroupInput` type exports alongside the schema.
  - Tests: 12 new round-trip cases in `packages/spec/src/data/object.test.ts` covering minimal/full-group parsing, required fields, snake_case key validation, declaration-order preservation, duplicate-key rejection, `Field.group` referencing, and `ObjectSchema.create()` integration.
### Fixed
- **Doubly-prefixed FQN for `@objectstack/objectos` system objects** — The ObjectOS-layer object definitions (`SysObject`, `SysView`, `SysAgent`, `SysTool`, `SysFlow`, `SysMetadata`) were being registered with fully-qualified names like `sys__sys_object`, `sys__sys_view`, `sys__sys_metadata`, because each object hard-coded a `sys_` prefix into its `name` **and** its manifest was registered under `namespace: 'sys'`, causing `SchemaRegistry.computeFQN(namespace, name)` to apply the prefix twice. The object `name` values are now the unprefixed short form (`object`, `view`, `agent`, `tool`, `flow`, `metadata`), producing the correct FQNs (`sys__object`, `sys__view`, `sys__agent`, `sys__tool`, `sys__flow`). `SysMetadata` (which would collide with the canonical `sys__metadata` owned by `@objectstack/metadata`) is now exported separately and excluded from the auto-registered `SystemObjects` catalog to avoid ownership conflicts; consumers that need it can still import it directly. See `packages/objectos/src/objects/*.ts` and `packages/objectos/src/registry.ts`.

### Added
- **Environment-per-database multi-tenancy (`service-tenant` v4.1)** — Refactored the multi-tenant architecture from "per-organization database" to **per-environment database** high-isolation, with a hard split between Control Plane (environment registry / addressing / credentials / RBAC) and Data Plane (one physical database per environment). See [`docs/adr/0002-environment-database-isolation.md`](docs/adr/0002-environment-database-isolation.md) for the full rationale and trade-offs.
  - **Zod protocol schemas** (`packages/spec/src/cloud/environment.zod.ts`): `EnvironmentSchema`, `EnvironmentDatabaseSchema`, `DatabaseCredentialSchema`, `EnvironmentMemberSchema`, `EnvironmentTypeSchema`, `EnvironmentStatusSchema`, `EnvironmentRoleSchema`, `DatabaseCredentialStatusSchema`, `ProvisionEnvironmentRequest/ResponseSchema`, `ProvisionOrganizationRequest/ResponseSchema`. `TenantDatabaseSchema` is now marked `@deprecated`.
  - **Control-plane objects** (`packages/services/service-tenant/src/objects/`): `sys_environment` (UNIQUE `(organization_id, slug)`), `sys_environment_database` (UNIQUE `environment_id` — exactly one DB per environment), `sys_database_credential` (rotatable, encrypted, with `active` / `rotating` / `revoked` lifecycle), `sys_environment_member` (UNIQUE `(environment_id, user_id)`, owner / admin / maker / reader / guest). Every field carries `.describe()` metadata and every uniqueness constraint is explicit.
  - **`EnvironmentProvisioningService`** (`packages/services/service-tenant/src/environment-provisioning.ts`): `provisionOrganization()` bootstraps a new org with a default environment and DB in one call; `provisionEnvironment()` allocates any subsequent dev / test / sandbox / preview environment; `rotateCredential()` mints a new `active` credential and revokes the previous one. Pluggable `EnvironmentDatabaseAdapter` (initial `turso`; `libsql` / `sqlite` / `postgres` drop in without core changes) and `SecretEncryptor` hooks.
  - **Tenant plugin wiring**: `createTenantPlugin()` now registers all four new control-plane objects out of the box, plus `sys_tenant_database` as a v4.x shim (opt out via `registerLegacyTenantDatabase: false`).
  - **v4 → v5 migration skeleton** (`packages/services/service-tenant/migrations/v4-to-v5-env-migration.ts`): idempotent, non-destructive, re-encrypts credentials with the current KMS key, reuses existing physical DBs as each org's new `prod` environment DB — no data movement required.
  - **Tests**: 22 new schema round-trip tests in `packages/spec/src/cloud/environment.test.ts`, 10 new provisioning tests in `packages/services/service-tenant/src/environment-provisioning.test.ts` covering organization bootstrap, environment creation, default-environment invariants, adapter routing, credential rotation, and encryption hooks.

### Deprecated
- **`TenantDatabaseSchema` / `sys_tenant_database`** — Superseded by the environment-per-database model above. The schema and object remain registered in v4.x as a deprecation shim; both will be removed in **v5.0**. Consumers should migrate by running `migrateV4ToV5Environments()` before upgrading to v5.0.

### Changed
- **Polished `examples/app-crm` dashboards** — Rewrote `executive`, `sales`, and `service` dashboards and added a new unified `crm` overview dashboard, modeled after the reference implementation at [objectstack-ai/objectui/examples/crm](https://github.com/objectstack-ai/objectui/tree/main/examples/crm/src/dashboards). The dashboards now use the framework's first-class metadata fields instead of ad-hoc hex strings stuffed into `options.color`:
  - Semantic `colorVariant` tokens (`success`/`warning`/`danger`/`blue`/`teal`/`purple`/`orange`) replace raw hex codes
  - Each widget carries a `description`, `chartConfig` (axes, color palette, annotations, interaction), and a header `actionUrl`/`actionType`/`actionIcon` for drill-down
  - Each dashboard declares a structured `header` with action buttons, a `dateRange` global time filter, `globalFilters` (owner / industry / priority lookups), and a `refreshInterval`
  - KPI metric widgets carry `icon`, `format`, and `trend` indicators (direction + delta + label) in `options`, mirroring the objectui reference visual style
  - Chart variety expanded: `area` (revenue trends), `donut` (lead source / industry), `funnel` (pipeline by stage), `gauge` (SLA compliance), `horizontal-bar` (rep ranking), with proper axis titles and value formatters
  - Table widgets use structured `columns: [{ header, accessorKey, format }]` instead of bare field-name arrays
  - New `examples/app-crm/test/dashboard.test.ts` validates every dashboard against `DashboardSchema` and enforces these conventions

### Added
- **Release-readiness documentation pass (42 packages)** — Aligned every `@objectstack/*` package for the formal v4.x release:
  - Canonical README template and `package.json` publishing checklist committed at `docs/internal/PACKAGE_README_TEMPLATE.md`
  - New `packages/services/service-package/README.md` documenting the package registry service
  - All `package.json` files now carry `description`, at least 3 `keywords`, a full `repository` block with `directory`, `homepage`, `bugs`, `engines.node`, `publishConfig.access: public`, and a `files` whitelist
  - `@objectstack/service-tenant` (was `0.1.0`) and `@objectstack/service-package` (was `1.0.0`) bumped to `4.0.4` in lockstep with the release train
  - Rewrote thin READMEs for `core`, `rest`, `driver-memory`, `plugin-security`, and all seven framework adapters (`express`, `fastify`, `hono`, `nestjs`, `nextjs`, `nuxt`, `sveltekit`) to the canonical structure: overview, installation, quick start, key exports, configuration, when/when-not, related packages, and docs links
  - Updated `content/docs/guides/packages.mdx` and `content/docs/concepts/packages.mdx` to reflect the actual **42 package** inventory and to include `service-package` and `service-tenant`

### Fixed
- **Studio left metadata list not refreshing on package switch** — In `apps/studio/src/routes/$package.tsx`, the `AppSidebar` package-switcher's `onSelectPackage` handler only updated local `selectedPackage` state. A URL→state `useEffect` in the same layout then immediately reverted that state back to match the unchanged `$package` route param, so `AppSidebar.loadMetadata` (keyed on `selectedPackage`) never re-ran and the left metadata tree stayed stuck on the previous package. The dropdown now navigates to `/$newPackage`, making the URL the single source of truth; the URL→state effect then updates `selectedPackage` normally and the metadata list refreshes for the new package. (`apps/studio/src/routes/$package.tsx`)
- **Cross-origin auth tokens stripped in `@objectstack/hono` adapter (follow-up to PR #1178)** — `createHonoApp()` was not exposing `set-auth-token` via `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`, diverging from `plugin-hono-server`'s CORS wiring. On Vercel deployments (where all traffic flows through `createHonoApp()`), the browser stripped the header from every response, preventing the better-auth `bearer()` plugin from delivering rotated session tokens to cross-origin clients. Cross-origin sessions silently broke even after the wildcard fixes in #1177/#1178. The adapter now always includes `set-auth-token` in `exposeHeaders`, merged with any user-supplied values, mirroring the invariant established in commit `151dd19c`. (`packages/adapters/hono/src/index.ts`)
- **CORS wildcard patterns in `@objectstack/hono` adapter (follow-up to PR #1177)** — `createHonoApp()` was the third CORS code path that still treated wildcard origins (e.g. `https://*.objectui.org`) as literal strings when passing them to Hono's `cors()` middleware. Because `apps/server` routes all non-OPTIONS requests through this adapter on Vercel, the browser would see a successful preflight (handled by the Vercel short-circuit) followed by a POST/GET response with no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, blocking every real request. The adapter now imports `hasWildcardPattern` / `createOriginMatcher` from `@objectstack/plugin-hono-server` and uses the same matcher-function branch as `plugin-hono-server`, so all three Hono-based CORS paths share a single source of truth. (`packages/adapters/hono/src/index.ts`)
- **CORS wildcard patterns on Vercel deployments** — `CORS_ORIGIN` values containing wildcard patterns (e.g. `https://*.objectui.org,https://*.objectstack.ai,http://localhost:*`) no longer cause browser CORS errors when `apps/server` is deployed to Vercel. The Vercel entrypoint's OPTIONS preflight short-circuit previously matched origins with a literal `Array.includes()`, treating `*` as a plain character and rejecting legitimate subdomains. It now shares the same pattern-matching logic as the Hono plugin's `cors()` middleware via new exports `createOriginMatcher` / `hasWildcardPattern` / `matchOriginPattern` / `normalizeOriginPatterns` from `@objectstack/plugin-hono-server`. (`apps/server/server/index.ts`, `packages/plugins/plugin-hono-server/src/pattern-matcher.ts`)

### Added
- **Claude Code integration (`CLAUDE.md`)** — Added root `CLAUDE.md` file so that [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) automatically loads the project's system prompt when launched in the repository. Content is synced with `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and includes build/test quick-reference commands, all prime directives, monorepo structure, protocol domains, coding patterns, and domain-specific prompt references. This complements the existing GitHub Copilot instructions and `skills/` directory.
- **AI Skills documentation pages** — Added two new documentation pages covering the Skills System:
  - `content/docs/concepts/skills.mdx` — Conceptual overview of the skills architecture, philosophy, and structure
  - `content/docs/guides/skills.mdx` — Complete reference for all 10 ObjectStack AI skills with usage examples and prompts
  - Updated top-level navigation to include `concepts` section
  - Added skills links to homepage cards, guides index, and navigation meta files

### Changed
- **Skills Module Structure Refactor** — Refactored all skills in `skills/` directory to follow shadcn-ui's fine-grained layering pattern. Each skill now has:
  - **Concise `SKILL.md`** — High-level overview with decision trees and quick-start examples, referencing detailed rules
  - **`rules/` directory** — Detailed implementation rules with incorrect/correct code examples for better AI comprehension
  - **`evals/` directory** — Placeholder for future evaluation tests to validate AI assistant understanding
  - **Skills refactored:**
    - `objectstack-schema` (formerly `objectstack-data`) — Extracted rules for naming, relationships, validation, indexing, field types, and hooks (moved from objectstack-hooks)
    - `objectstack-plugin` (formerly `objectstack-kernel`) — Extracted rules for plugin lifecycle, service registry, and hooks/events system
    - `objectstack-query` — NEW skill for filters, sorting, pagination, aggregation, joins, expand, full-text search, window functions
    - `objectstack-hooks` — **DEPRECATED** and consolidated into `objectstack-schema/rules/hooks.md` (hooks are core to data operations)
    - `objectstack-ui`, `objectstack-api`, `objectstack-automation`, `objectstack-ai`, `objectstack-i18n`, `objectstack-quickstart` — Added `rules/` and `evals/` structure with initial pattern documentation
  - **Benefits:**
    - Improved maintainability — Detailed rules are separated from high-level overview
    - Better AI comprehension — Incorrect/correct examples make patterns clearer
    - Enhanced testability — `evals/` directory ready for skill validation tests
    - Reduced skill overlap — Hooks integrated into data skill where they belong
    - Preserved skill independence — Each skill remains independently installable/referenceable (no global routing required)

### Fixed
- **Studio tests: failing CI on `main`** — Fixed several long-standing test-suite issues in `@objectstack/studio` that broke the `Test Core` CI job:
  - **Broken relative paths** — Tests in `test/plugins/` used `../src/...` but were two levels deep, causing Vite/Vitest to report `Failed to resolve import "../src/plugins"`. Corrected to `../../src/...`.
  - **`vitest.config.ts` missing required aliases** — The dedicated `vitest.config.ts` only declared the `@` alias while `vite.config.ts` declared ~25 more (e.g. `@objectstack/plugin-auth/objects`, node built-in stubs). Tests that transitively imported `src/mocks/createKernel.ts` failed with `"./objects" is not exported …`. `vitest.config.ts` now mirrors the full alias set used by `vite.config.ts`.
  - **Removed stale tests against non-existent APIs** — Deleted `test/components/AppSidebar.test.tsx`, `test/components/ObjectDataForm.test.tsx`, `test/components/ObjectDataTable.test.tsx`. These were added as scaffolding against APIs that don't match the current components (wrong prop names, missing TanStack Router context) and never passed in CI.
  - **Rewrote `test/plugins/plugin-system.test.tsx`** to match the actual `PluginRegistry` API (`getPlugins`, `getViewers`, `registerAndActivate`, etc.) and `PluginRegistryProvider` async activation lifecycle.
- **Studio: Package switcher not filtering object list** — Fixed a bug where switching packages in the Studio left sidebar did not change the displayed object list. The root cause was in `ObjectStackProtocolImplementation.getMetaItems()`: after filtering items by `packageId` via `SchemaRegistry.listItems()`, the code merged in ALL runtime items from MetadataService without respecting the `packageId` filter, effectively overriding the filtered results. The same issue existed in `HttpDispatcher.handleMetadata()` where the MetadataService fallback path also ignored `packageId`. Both paths now correctly filter MetadataService items by `_packageId` when a package scope is requested.
- **MetadataPlugin driver bridging fallback** — Fixed `MetadataPlugin.start()` so the driver service scan fallback (`driver.*`) is reached when ObjectQL returns `null` (not just when it throws). Previously, `setDatabaseDriver` was never called in environments where ObjectQL was not loaded.
- **Auth trustedOrigins test alignment** — Updated `plugin-auth` tests to match the auto-default `http://localhost:*` behavior added in PR #1152 for better-auth CORS support. When no `trustedOrigins` are configured, the implementation correctly defaults to trusting all localhost ports for development convenience.
- **Docs build: lucide-react module resolution** — Added Turbopack `resolveAlias` in `apps/docs/next.config.mjs` so MDX content files in `content/docs/` (outside the app directory) can resolve `lucide-react`. Turbopack starts module resolution from the file's directory, which doesn't have access to the app's `node_modules/`.
- **Client Hono integration test timeout** — Fixed `afterAll` hook timeout in `client.hono.test.ts` by racing `kernel.shutdown()` against a 10s deadline. The shutdown can hang when pino's worker-thread flush callback never fires in CI, so the race ensures the hook completes within the 30s vitest limit.
- **CI: Replace `pnpm/action-setup@v6` with corepack** — Switched all GitHub Actions workflows (`ci.yml`, `lint.yml`, `release.yml`, `validate-deps.yml`, `pr-automation.yml`) from `pnpm/action-setup@v6` to `corepack enable` to fix persistent `ERR_PNPM_BROKEN_LOCKFILE` errors. Corepack reads the exact `packageManager` field from `package.json` (including SHA verification), ensuring the correct pnpm version is used in CI. Also bumped pnpm store cache keys to v3 and added a pnpm version verification step.
- **Broken pnpm lockfile** — Regenerated `pnpm-lock.yaml` from scratch to fix `ERR_PNPM_BROKEN_LOCKFILE` ("expected a single document in the stream, but found more") that was causing all CI jobs to fail. The previous merge of PR #1117 only included workflow cache key changes but did not carry over the regenerated lockfile.
- **service-ai: Fix navigation item labels using deprecated i18n object format** — Replaced `{ key, defaultValue }` i18n objects with plain string labels in `AIServicePlugin`'s Setup App navigation contributions, completing the `I18nLabelSchema` migration from [#1054](https://github.com/objectstack-ai/framework/issues/1054).

### Added
- **MCP Runtime Server Plugin (`plugin-mcp-server`)** — New kernel plugin that exposes ObjectStack
  as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for external AI clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code
  Copilot, etc.). Features include:
  - **Tool Bridge**: All registered AI tools from `ToolRegistry` (9 built-in tools: `list_objects`,
    `describe_object`, `query_records`, `get_record`, `aggregate_data`, `create_object`, `add_field`,
    `modify_field`, `delete_field`) are automatically exposed as MCP tools with correct annotations
    (readOnlyHint, destructiveHint).
  - **Resource Bridge**: Object schemas (`objectstack://objects/{objectName}`), object list
    (`objectstack://objects`), record access (`objectstack://objects/{objectName}/records/{recordId}`),
    and metadata types (`objectstack://metadata/types`) exposed as MCP resources.
  - **Prompt Bridge**: Registered agents (`data_chat`, `metadata_assistant`, etc.) exposed as MCP
    prompts with context arguments (objectName, recordId, viewName).
  - **Transport**: stdio transport via `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` for local AI client integration.
  - **Environment Configuration**: `MCP_SERVER_ENABLED=true` to auto-start, `MCP_SERVER_NAME` and
    `MCP_SERVER_TRANSPORT` for customization.
  - **Extensibility**: `mcp:ready` kernel hook allows other plugins to extend the MCP server.
  - Studio frontend AI interface remains unchanged — it continues to use REST/SSE via
    Vercel Data Stream Protocol.

### Changed
- **Unified `list_objects` / `describe_object` tools (`service-ai`)** — Merged the duplicate
  `list_metadata_objects` → `list_objects` and `describe_metadata_object` → `describe_object`
  tool pairs. Both `data_chat` and `metadata_assistant` agents now share the same unified tools
  with full `filter`, `includeFields`, snake_case validation, and `enableFeatures` support.
  `DATA_TOOL_DEFINITIONS` is reduced from 5 to 3 (query-only tools), while
  `METADATA_TOOL_DEFINITIONS` retains all 6 tools under the unified names. The duplicate
  `ObjectDef`/`FieldDef` type definitions in `data-tools.ts` are removed.

### Fixed
- **MetadataPlugin: Driver bridging for database-backed persistence** — `MetadataPlugin.start()`
  now discovers registered driver services (`driver.*`) from the kernel service registry and
  calls `manager.setDatabaseDriver()` to enable `DatabaseLoader`. Previously, no code bridged
  the kernel's database driver to the `MetadataManager`, leaving `DatabaseLoader` unconfigured
  and metadata persistence limited to the filesystem only.
- **MetadataManager: register() no longer writes to FilesystemLoader** — `register()` now
  persists metadata only to `datasource:` protocol loaders (i.e. `DatabaseLoader`), skipping
  `file:` protocol loaders (`FilesystemLoader`). Previously, `register()` broadcast writes to
  all loaders indiscriminately, causing crashes in read-only environments (e.g. serverless,
  containerized deployments) when `FilesystemLoader.save()` attempted to write to disk.
  The same protocol filter is applied to `unregister()` for consistency.
- **Agent Chat: Vercel SSE Data Stream support** — The agent chat endpoint
  (`/api/v1/ai/agents/:agentName/chat`) now returns Vercel AI SDK v6 UI Message Stream Protocol
  (SSE) by default, matching the general chat endpoint behaviour. Previously, the agent chat route
  only returned plain JSON, causing `DefaultChatTransport` (used by `@ai-sdk/react` `useChat`) to
  fail silently — the API responded correctly but the Studio AI Chat Panel rendered no content.
  The endpoint now uses `streamChatWithTools` + `encodeVercelDataStream` for `stream !== false`
  requests (the default), and falls back to JSON only when `stream: false` is explicitly set.
  Studio's error UI is also enhanced to surface SSE parse failures clearly instead of silent failure.
- **Agent Chat: Vercel AI SDK v6 `parts` format support** — The agent chat endpoint
  (`/api/v1/ai/agents/:agentName/chat`) now accepts Vercel AI SDK v6 `parts`-based message
  format in addition to the legacy `content` string format. Previously, sending messages
  with `parts` (as `useChat` v6 does by default) resulted in a 400 error:
  `"message.content must be a string"`. Shared validation and normalization utilities
  (`validateMessageContent`, `normalizeMessage`) are extracted into `message-utils.ts`
  for reuse across both the general chat and agent chat routes.
- **Studio: Code tab now shows CodeExporter** — The Code tab in Studio metadata detail pages
  now correctly renders the `CodeExporter` component (TypeScript/JSON export with copy-to-clipboard)
  instead of always showing the JSON Inspector preview. The default plugin now registers two separate
  viewers: `json-inspector` for preview mode and `code-exporter` for code mode.
- **CI Test Failures** — Resolved test failures across multiple packages:
  - `@objectstack/service-ai`: Fixed SDK fallback test by mocking `@ai-sdk/openai` dynamic import
    (SDK now available as transitive workspace dependency)
  - `@objectstack/nuxt`, `@objectstack/nextjs`, `@objectstack/fastify`, `@objectstack/sveltekit`:
    Added missing `prefix` argument to `dispatch()` assertion calls in adapter tests
  - `@objectstack/plugin-auth`: Updated `dependencies` assertion and added `manifest` service mock
    to match current plugin implementation

### Added
- **AIServicePlugin Auto-Detection** — AIServicePlugin now automatically detects and initializes
  LLM providers based on environment variables, eliminating the need for manual adapter configuration
  in each deployment:
  - Auto-detection priority: `AI_GATEWAY_MODEL` → `OPENAI_API_KEY` → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`
  - Graceful fallback to MemoryLLMAdapter when no provider is configured
  - Comprehensive logging of selected provider and warnings for missing SDKs
  - Supports custom model selection via `AI_MODEL` environment variable
  - Consistent behavior across CLI, Vercel, Docker, and custom deployments
  - Dynamic import failures are handled as soft errors with automatic fallback
  ([#1067](https://github.com/objectstack-ai/framework/issues/1067))

- **Metadata Versioning & History** — Comprehensive version history tracking and rollback capabilities
  for metadata items. Key features include:
  - `MetadataHistoryRecordSchema` defining structure for historical snapshots
  - `sys_metadata_history` system table for version storage
  - Automatic history tracking in `DatabaseLoader` with SHA-256 checksum deduplication
  - `getHistory()`, `rollback()`, and `diff()` methods in `IMetadataService`
  - REST API endpoints: `GET /history`, `POST /rollback`, `GET /diff`
  - `HistoryCleanupManager` with configurable retention policies (age-based and count-based)
  - Comprehensive test suite covering all history operations

  This aligns ObjectStack with enterprise platforms like Salesforce Setup Audit Trail and
  ServiceNow Update Sets. See `docs/METADATA_HISTORY.md` for detailed usage.

- **CLI: Remote API Commands** - Added 12 new CLI commands for interacting with remote ObjectStack servers:
  - **Authentication**: `os auth login`, `os auth logout`, `os auth whoami`
  - **Data API**: `os data query`, `os data get`, `os data create`, `os data update`, `os data delete`
  - **Metadata API**: `os meta list`, `os meta get`, `os meta register`, `os meta delete`
  - All commands support `--url` and `--token` flags, or use stored credentials from `~/.objectstack/credentials.json`
  - Multiple output formats: `--format json|table|yaml` (yaml available on all commands)
  - Environment variable support: `OBJECTSTACK_URL`, `OBJECTSTACK_TOKEN`
  - See [REMOTE_API_COMMANDS.md](./REMOTE_API_COMMANDS.md) for full documentation

### Changed
- **i18n: `I18nLabelSchema` now accepts `string` only** — `label`, `description`, `title`,
  and other display-text fields across all UI schemas (`AppSchema`, `NavigationArea`,
  `PageSchema`, `DashboardWidgetSchema`, `ReportSchema`, `ChartSchema`, `NotificationSchema`,
  `AriaPropsSchema`, etc.) now accept only plain strings. The previous `string | I18nObject`
  union type has been replaced with `z.string()`. i18n translation keys will be auto-generated
  by the framework at registration time; developers only need to provide the default-language
  string value. Translations are managed through translation files, not inline i18n objects.
  ([#1054](https://github.com/objectstack-ai/framework/issues/1054))

  **Migration:** Replace any `label: { key: '...', defaultValue: 'X' }` with `label: 'X'`.
  Existing plain-string labels require no changes.

  **Affected plugins updated:**
  - `@objectstack/plugin-setup` — `setup-app.ts`, `setup-areas.ts`
  - `@objectstack/plugin-auth` — navigation item labels
  - `@objectstack/plugin-security` — navigation item labels
  - `@objectstack/plugin-audit` — navigation item labels

### Documentation
- **README rewrite** — Rewrote `README.md` to accurately reflect the `objectstack-ai/framework`
  repository. Updates include: corrected title ("ObjectStack Framework"), updated badges
  (v4.0.1, 6,507 tests passing), fixed stale clone URL (`spec.git` → `framework.git`),
  added all missing packages (`driver-sql`, `driver-turso`, `plugin-audit`, `plugin-setup`,
  `service-feed`, `service-automation`, `service-ai`, `service-realtime`, `service-i18n`),
  updated codebase metrics (27 packages, 200 Zod schema files, 1,600+ exported schemas,
  8,750+ `.describe()` annotations, 6,507 tests passing), and restructured sections to
  match the current monorepo layout.

### Fixed
- **AI Chat agent selector missing `data_chat` and `metadata_assistant`** — Fixed `GET /api/v1/ai/agents`
  returning 404, which caused the Studio AI Chat panel to show only "General Chat". There were two
  root causes addressed by this fix:
  1. **Kernel bootstrap timing** (`packages/core/src/kernel.ts`): 'core' service in-memory fallbacks
     (e.g. the 'metadata' service) were only injected in `validateSystemRequirements()` which runs
     AFTER all plugin `start()` methods execute. This meant `ctx.getService('metadata')` always threw
     during `AIServicePlugin.start()` when no explicit `MetadataPlugin` was loaded. Fix: added
     `preInjectCoreFallbacks()` called between Phase 1 (init) and Phase 2 (start), ensuring all core
     service fallbacks are available before any plugin's `start()` runs.
  2. **Shadowed variable** (`packages/services/service-ai/src/plugin.ts`): a redundant second
     `ctx.getService('metadata')` call declared a new `const metadataService` that shadowed the outer
     `let metadataService` and failed silently, preventing `buildAgentRoutes()` from being called even
     if the metadata service was available. Fix: reuse the already-resolved outer variable.
  Additionally, added a fallback in `DispatcherPlugin.start()` that recovers AI routes from the
  `kernel.__aiRoutes` cache in case the `ai:routes` hook fires before the listener is registered
  (timing edge case).
- **ObjectQLPlugin: cold-start metadata restoration** — `ObjectQLPlugin.start()` now calls
  `protocol.loadMetaFromDb()` after driver initialization and before schema sync, restoring
  all persisted metadata (objects, views, apps, etc.) from the `sys_metadata` table into the
  in-memory `SchemaRegistry`. Previously, user-created custom objects were lost after kernel
  cold starts or redeployments because the hydration step was missing. The fix gracefully
  degrades in in-memory-only or first-run scenarios where `sys_metadata` does not yet exist.
- **Studio Vercel API routes returning HTML instead of JSON** — Adopted the
  same Vercel deployment pattern used by `hotcrm`: committed
  `api/[[...route]].js` catch-all route so Vercel detects it pre-build,
  switched esbuild output from CJS to ESM (fixes `"type": "module"` conflict),
  and changed the bundle output to `api/_handler.js` (a separate file that
  the committed wrapper re-exports).  This avoids both Vercel's TS
  compilation overwriting the bundle (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`) and the
  "File not found" error from deleting source files during build.
  Added `createRequire` banner to the esbuild config so that CJS
  dependencies (knex/tarn) can `require()` Node.js built-in modules like
  `events` without the "Dynamic require is not supported" error.
  Added `functions.includeFiles` in `vercel.json` to include native addons
  (`better-sqlite3`, `@libsql/client`) that esbuild cannot bundle.
  Added a build step to copy native external modules from the monorepo root
  `node_modules/` into the studio's local `node_modules/`, since pnpm's strict
  mode (unlike hotcrm's `shamefully-hoist`) doesn't symlink transitive native
  dependencies into app-level `node_modules/`.
  Updated rewrites to match: `/api/:path*` → `/api/[[...route]]`.
- **Studio CORS error on Vercel temporary/preview domains** — Changed
  `VITE_SERVER_URL` from hardcoded `https://play.objectstack.ai` to `""`
  (empty string / same-origin) in `vercel.json` so each deployment — including
  previews — calls its own serverless function instead of the production API
  cross-origin.  Also added Hono CORS middleware to `apps/studio/server/index.ts`
  as a safety net for any remaining cross-origin scenarios; dynamically allows
  all `*.vercel.app` subdomains, explicitly listed Vercel deployment URLs, and
  localhost.  Extracted `getVercelOrigins()` helper to keep CORS and
  better-auth `trustedOrigins` allowlists in sync.
- **Client test aligned with removed `ai.chat` method** — Updated
  `@objectstack/client` test suite to match the current API surface where
  `ai.chat()` was removed in favour of the Vercel AI SDK `useChat()` hook.
  The obsolete test that called `client.ai.chat()` now asserts the method is
  absent, fixing the CI `@objectstack/client#test` failure.

### Added
- **Metadata Assistant Agent (`service-ai`)** — New `metadata_assistant` agent definition that
  binds all 6 metadata management tools (`create_object`, `add_field`, `modify_field`,
  `delete_field`, `list_objects`, `describe_object`). Includes a tailored
  system prompt that guides the AI to use snake_case naming, verify existing schemas before
  modifications, and warn about destructive operations. Configured with `react` planning
  strategy (10 iterations, replan enabled) for multi-step schema design conversations.
- **Tool Confirmation Flags** — Added `requiresConfirmation: true` to `create_object` and
  `delete_field` tool definitions. These destructive/creation operations now signal to the
  frontend that user approval is needed before execution.
- **Frontend Tool Call Display (`AiChatPanel`)** — Enhanced the AI Chat Panel to render tool
  invocation parts from the Vercel AI SDK v6 stream protocol. Displays tool call status with
  visual indicators:
  - **Calling**: Spinner animation with tool name and argument summary
  - **Confirmation**: Yellow-bordered card with Approve/Deny buttons for `requiresConfirmation` tools
  - **Success**: Green success indicator with result preview
  - **Error**: Red error indicator with error message
  - **Denied**: Muted indicator for user-denied operations
- **Operation Confirmation Mechanism** — Integrated the Vercel AI SDK `addToolApprovalResponse`
  hook to support approval/denial workflows for tools marked with `requiresConfirmation`.
  When the server sends an `approval-requested` state, the chat panel shows Approve and Deny
  buttons. User decisions are sent back to the server to continue or abort the tool execution.
- **Metadata Management Tools (`service-ai`)** — Added 6 built-in AI tools for metadata
  CRUD operations, each defined as a first-class `Tool` metadata file using `defineTool()`
  from `@objectstack/spec/ai`:
  - `create-object.tool.ts` — Creates a new data object with schema validation
  - `add-field.tool.ts` — Adds a field to an existing object
  - `modify-field.tool.ts` — Modifies field properties on an object
  - `delete-field.tool.ts` — Removes a field from an object
  - `list-metadata-objects.tool.ts` — Lists all registered metadata objects
  - `describe-metadata-object.tool.ts` — Returns full schema details of an object
  
  Each `.tool.ts` file is an independent metadata unit with `name`, `label`, `description`,
  `category`, `builtIn`, and `parameters` — following the same `.object.ts` / `.view.ts`
  metadata file convention. Handler factories remain in `metadata-tools.ts` and bind handlers
  at `ai:ready` time via `registerMetadataTools(registry, { metadataService })`.
  79 unit tests covering tool metadata properties, handler execution, input validation,
  error handling, dual registration with data tools, and a full lifecycle test.
- **Agent Skills — `skills/` directory (agentskills.io)** — Created `skills/` folder at
  repository root following the [agentskills.io specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).
  Five expert-knowledge skills with hand-written `SKILL.md` files and `references/` quick-lookup
  tables:
  - `skills/schema-design/` — Data schema design (Object, Field, Validation, Index)
  - `skills/ui-design/` — UI protocol (View, App, Dashboard, Report, Action)
  - `skills/automation-design/` — Automation (Flow, Workflow, Trigger, Approval)
  - `skills/ai-agent-design/` — AI Agent protocol (Agent, Skill, RAG, Tool)
  - `skills/api-design/` — API protocol (REST endpoints, Discovery, Datasource)
  Each `SKILL.md` includes YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `license`, `metadata`),
  domain rules, usage guidance, best practices, common pitfalls, and code examples.
  Zod schema files remain the single source of truth; skills reference them for validation.
- **Discovery Schema — `ServiceStatus` enum & `handlerReady` field** — Added `'registered'`
  status to `ServiceInfoSchema` to distinguish routes that are declared in the dispatcher
  table but whose HTTP handler has not been verified. Added optional `handlerReady` boolean
  field (omitted = unverified/unknown) so clients can filter handler-ready services before
  displaying endpoints when the value is explicitly `true`.
- **Discovery Schema — `RouteHealthReportSchema`** — New schema for automated route/handler
  coverage reporting at startup. Includes per-route health entries (`pass`, `fail`, `missing`,
  `skip`) and summary counters.
- **Dispatcher Schema — `DispatcherErrorCode` & `DispatcherErrorResponseSchema`** — Semantic
  error codes (`404`/`405`/`501`/`503`) with machine-readable `type` field
  (`ROUTE_NOT_FOUND`, `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED`, `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`, `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`) and
  developer-facing `hint` strings.
- **Dispatcher Schema — `/health` route** — Added health endpoint to `DEFAULT_DISPATCHER_ROUTES`.
- **REST API Plugin — `handlerStatus` field** — Added `handlerStatus` (`implemented`, `stub`,
  `planned`) to `RestApiEndpointSchema` to track handler implementation readiness.
- **REST API Plugin — `RouteCoverageReportSchema`** — Schema for adapter-generated coverage
  reports listing every declared endpoint and its implementation status.
- `ai` v6 as a dependency of `@objectstack/spec` for type re-exports

### Removed
- **Removed `value` field from data API responses** — The `findData` protocol
  implementation no longer returns the deprecated `value` field alongside `records`.
  Only `records` is returned, matching the `FindDataResponseSchema` spec. All
  downstream consumers (Studio, server example, tests) updated to use `records`
  exclusively. OData-specific responses (`ODataResponseSchema`) retain `value` per
  the OData v4 standard — protocol-to-OData adaptation is handled in the HTTP
  dispatch layer.

### Changed
- **AI Chat Protocol Aligned with Vercel AI SDK** — Removed custom AI chat protocol
  types and Zod schemas (`AIMessage`, `AIToolCall`, `AIStreamEvent`,
  `AiChatRequestSchema`, `AiChatResponseSchema`) from `@objectstack/spec`. The
  canonical message, tool-call, and streaming types are now re-exported from the
  Vercel AI SDK (`ai` v6):
  - `ModelMessage` replaces `AIMessage`
  - `ToolCallPart` replaces `AIToolCall`
  - `ToolResultPart` replaces `AIToolResult`
  - `TextStreamPart<ToolSet>` replaces `AIStreamEvent`
  - `IAIService` and `LLMAdapter` method signatures now accept `ModelMessage[]`
    and return `TextStreamPart<ToolSet>` for streaming
  - Deprecated type aliases preserved for migration convenience
  - NLQ, Suggest, and Insights protocols (ObjectStack-specific) are retained
- **`@objectstack/service-ai` migrated to Vercel AI SDK types** — All source files
  and tests now use canonical Vercel types (`ModelMessage`, `ToolCallPart`,
  `ToolResultPart`, `TextStreamPart<ToolSet>`) instead of deprecated aliases:
  - `ToolRegistry.execute()` accepts `ToolCallPart` and returns `ToolExecutionResult`
    (extends `ToolResultPart` with `isError?: boolean`)
  - Tool call loop in `AIService.chatWithTools()` constructs proper
    `AssistantModelMessage` and `ToolModelMessage` with Vercel-format content arrays
  - `MemoryLLMAdapter.streamChat()` emits Vercel `TextStreamPart<ToolSet>` events
  - Conversation services serialize/deserialize `ModelMessage` union to flat DB columns
  - All 158 service-ai tests updated and passing

### Fixed
- **Runtime Dispatcher — semantic error differentiation** — `HttpDispatcher.dispatch()` now
  returns typed 404 (`ROUTE_NOT_FOUND`) with diagnostic info instead of bare `{ handled: false }`.
  Added `routeNotFound()` (404) helper method.
- **Runtime Dispatcher — `/health` handler** — Added health endpoint returning `status`,
  `timestamp`, `version`, and `uptime`.
- **Runtime Dispatcher — `handlerReady` in discovery** — `getDiscoveryInfo()` now emits
  `handlerReady: true` for services with confirmed handlers and `handlerReady: false` for
  unavailable services.
- **Dispatcher Plugin — semantic 404** — `sendResult()` now returns `ROUTE_NOT_FOUND` error
  type with a hint pointing to the discovery endpoint. Added `/health` handler registration.
- **Studio — handler-ready filtering** — `useApiDiscovery()` now checks both `enabled` and
  `handlerReady` (or `status === 'available' | 'degraded'` for backward compatibility) before
  displaying service endpoints in the UI.

### Removed
- `AiChatRequestSchema` / `AiChatResponseSchema` Zod schemas from
  `@objectstack/spec/api` — the AI chat wire protocol now uses Vercel AI SDK's
  data stream format (`toDataStreamResponse()`)
- `aiChat` method from `IObjectStackAPI` and client SDK — consumers should use
  `@ai-sdk/react/useChat` directly
- AI `/chat` endpoint from `DEFAULT_AI_ROUTES` plugin REST API definition

### Added
- `ai` v6 as a dependency of `@objectstack/spec` for type re-exports
- **Vercel AI Data Stream Protocol support on `/api/v1/ai/chat`** — The chat
  endpoint now supports dual-mode responses:
  - **Streaming (default)**: When `stream` is not `false`, returns Vercel Data
    Stream Protocol frames (`0:` text, `9:` tool-call, `d:` finish, etc.),
    directly consumable by `@ai-sdk/react/useChat`
  - **JSON (legacy)**: When `stream: false`, returns the original JSON response
  - Accepts Vercel useChat flat body format (`system`, `model`, `temperature`,
    `maxTokens` as top-level fields) alongside the legacy `{ messages, options }`
  - `systemPrompt` / `system` field is prepended as a system message
  - Message validation now accepts Vercel multi-part array content
  - `RouteResponse.vercelDataStream` flag signals HTTP server layer to encode
    events using the Vercel Data Stream frame format
- **`VercelLLMAdapter`** — Production adapter wrapping Vercel AI SDK's
  `generateText` / `streamText` for any compatible model provider (OpenAI,
  Anthropic, Google, Ollama, etc.)
- **`vercel-stream-encoder.ts`** — Utilities (`encodeStreamPart`,
  `encodeVercelDataStream`) to convert `TextStreamPart<ToolSet>` events into
  Vercel Data Stream wire-format frames
- 176 service-ai tests passing (18 new tests for stream encoder, route
  dual-mode, systemPrompt, flat options, array content)

## [4.0.1] — 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **Version Alignment Patch** — Unified all package versions to `4.0.1`. Previously,
  `@objectstack/driver-sql` and `@objectstack/driver-turso` were at `3.3.2`, example
  packages were at `3.0.26`, and the root monorepo was at `3.0.8` while all other
  `@objectstack/*` packages were at `4.0.0`. All packages now share a single, consistent
  version number aligned with the changeset `fixed` group configuration.

### Added
- **`@objectstack/service-realtime` — `sys_presence` System Object** — Registers the
  `sys_presence` system object in the `service-realtime` package as the canonical Presence
  domain object. Fields align with the `PresenceStateSchema` protocol definition
  (`user_id`, `session_id`, `status`, `last_seen`, `current_location`, `device`,
  `custom_status`, `metadata`). `RealtimeServicePlugin` now auto-registers the object
  via the `app.com.objectstack.service.realtime` service convention. Added
  `SystemObjectName.PRESENCE` constant (`'sys_presence'`) to `@objectstack/spec/system`.
- **`@objectstack/service-ai` — Data Chatbot: Tool Call Loop & Agent Runtime** — Implements
  an Airtable Copilot-style data conversation Chatbot with full-stack support:
  - `AIService.chatWithTools()` — automatic multi-round LLM ↔ tool call loop with
    `maxIterations` safety limit, parallel tool execution, and forced final response
  - `AIResult.toolCalls` — new field on the AI result contract so adapters can return
    tool call requests from the LLM
  - `ChatWithToolsOptions` — new contract interface extending `AIRequestOptions`
  - 5 built-in data tools: `list_objects`, `describe_object`, `query_records`,
    `get_record`, `aggregate_data` — with parameter schemas, limit capping (max 200),
    and error handling
  - `registerDataTools(registry, context)` — factory to register all data tools
    against `IDataEngine` + `IMetadataService`
  - `AgentRuntime` — loads agent metadata, builds system prompts from instructions +
    UI context (`objectName`, `recordId`, `viewName`), resolves agent tool references
    against the `ToolRegistry`
  - `buildAgentRoutes()` — new `POST /api/v1/ai/agents/:agentName/chat` route with
    agent lookup, active-check, context injection, and `chatWithTools` integration
  - `DATA_CHAT_AGENT` — built-in `data_chat` agent spec with role, instructions,
    guardrails, planning config, and tool declarations
  - `AIServicePlugin` auto-registers data tools and `data_chat` agent when
    `IDataEngine` + `IMetadataService` are available in the kernel
  - 42 new test cases covering tool call loop, data tools, agent runtime, agent
    routes, and agent spec validation
- **`@objectstack/service-ai` — ObjectQL-backed persistent ConversationService** — New
  `ObjectQLConversationService` implements `IAIConversationService` using `IDataEngine`
  for durable conversation and message storage across service restarts:
  - `ai_conversations` and `ai_messages` system object definitions (namespace `ai`)
  - Full CRUD: `create`, `get`, `list` (with userId/agentId/limit/cursor filters),
    `addMessage` (with toolCalls/toolCallId support), and `delete` (cascade)
  - `AIServicePlugin` auto-detects `IDataEngine` in the kernel service registry and
    uses `ObjectQLConversationService` when available, falling back to
    `InMemoryConversationService` for dev/test environments
  - `AIServicePluginOptions.conversationService` allows explicit override
  - Plugin registers AI system objects via `app.com.objectstack.service-ai` service
  - 16 new test cases covering all five interface methods plus edge cases
- **Promoted `LLMAdapter` interface to `@objectstack/spec/contracts`** — Moved the `LLMAdapter`
  adapter contract from `@objectstack/service-ai` internal types to the canonical protocol layer
  (`packages/spec/src/contracts/llm-adapter.ts`). Third-party adapter implementations (OpenAI,
  Anthropic, Ollama, etc.) can now depend solely on `@objectstack/spec` for type alignment.
  `service-ai` re-exports the interface for backward compatibility.

### Fixed
- **Changeset fixed versioning — add driver-sql and driver-turso** — Added `@objectstack/driver-sql`
  and `@objectstack/driver-turso` to the changeset `fixed` versioning group in `.changeset/config.json`.
  These packages were missing from the group, causing them to be published as `3.3.2` instead of `4.0.0`
  during the v4.0.0 release. All future releases will now keep these driver packages in sync with the
  rest of the ecosystem.
- **ObjectQL build failure** — Fixed TypeScript TS2345 errors in `packages/objectql/src/protocol.ts`
  where `SchemaRegistry.registerItem()` calls failed type checking for the `keyField` parameter.
  Applied `'name' as any` cast consistent with the established codebase pattern.
- **ObjectQL `loadMetaFromDb`** — Fixed metadata hydration for `object` type records to use
  `SchemaRegistry.registerObject()` instead of `registerItem()`, resolving a mismatch where
  objects registered via `registerItem` could not be retrieved via `getItem('object', ...)`.
- **Adapter discovery endpoints** — Fixed discovery route in Hono, SvelteKit, Nuxt, Next.js,
  and Fastify adapters to serve discovery info at the API prefix root (e.g., `GET /api`)
  instead of a `/discovery` subpath. Updated `.well-known/objectstack` redirects accordingly.
- **Client feed namespace routing** — Fixed `ObjectStackClient.feed` methods to use the `data`
  route (`/api/v1/data/{object}/{recordId}/feed`) instead of a separate `/api/v1/feed` route,
  matching the actual server-side routing where feed is a sub-resource of data.

### Added
- **`@objectstack/service-ai` — Unified AI capability service plugin** — New kernel plugin
  providing standardized AI service integration:
  - Registers as kernel `'ai'` service conforming to `IAIService` contract
  - LLM adapter layer with provider abstraction (`LLMAdapter` interface) and built-in
    `MemoryLLMAdapter` for testing/development
  - `ToolRegistry` for metadata/business tool registration and execution
  - `InMemoryConversationService` implementing `IAIConversationService` for multi-turn
    conversation management with message persistence
  - REST/SSE route self-registration (`/api/v1/ai/chat`, `/api/v1/ai/chat/stream`,
    `/api/v1/ai/complete`, `/api/v1/ai/models`, `/api/v1/ai/conversations`)
  - Plugin lifecycle hooks (`ai:ready`, `ai:routes`) for extensibility
- **Expanded `IAIService` contract** — Added streaming (`streamChat`), tool calling protocol
  (`AIToolDefinition`, `AIToolCall`, `AIToolResult`, `AIMessageWithTools`,
  `AIRequestOptionsWithTools`, `AIStreamEvent`), and conversation management
  (`IAIConversationService`, `AIConversation`) to `packages/spec/src/contracts/ai-service.ts`
- **`@objectstack/plugin-setup` — Platform Setup App plugin** — New internal plugin
  (`packages/plugins/plugin-setup`) that owns and finalizes the platform Setup App.
  Ships four built-in Setup Areas (Administration, Platform, System, AI) as empty
  skeletons. Other plugins contribute navigation items via the `setupNav` service
  during their `init` phase. At `start`, SetupPlugin merges all contributions,
  filters out empty areas, and registers the finalized Setup App as an internal
  platform app. This establishes clear architectural separation: **spec** = protocol
  only, **objectql** = data/query only, **plugins** = system feature and UI composition.

### Documentation
- **Unified API query syntax documentation with Spec canonical format** — Rewrote
  `content/docs/protocol/objectql/query-syntax.mdx` and
  `content/docs/guides/contracts/data-engine.mdx` to align all examples, interface
  definitions, and field names with the canonical `QuerySchema`, `FilterConditionSchema`,
  and `EngineQueryOptionsSchema` from `@objectstack/spec`. All query examples now use
  `where` + MongoDB-style `$op` object syntax (replacing legacy tuple/`filters`/三元组
  format), `orderBy` (replacing `sort`), `groupBy` (replacing `group_by`), and
  `aggregations` array (replacing `aggregate` object map). `IDataEngine` contract
  documentation updated to reflect the real interface (`find`/`findOne`/`insert`/
  `update`/`delete`/`count`/`aggregate`). Added legacy compatibility sections clearly
  marking tuple/array syntax as UI-builder input only, with migration guidance.

### Changed
- **Studio Vercel deployment — switched from InMemoryDriver to TursoDriver** — The Studio serverless
  API entrypoint (`apps/studio/api/index.ts`) now uses `@objectstack/driver-turso` (TursoDriver)
  instead of `@objectstack/driver-memory` (InMemoryDriver) for Vercel deployments. In production,
  the driver connects to a Turso cloud database via `TURSO_DATABASE_URL` and `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`
  environment variables (remote mode). For local development without those variables, it falls back
  to `:memory:` (ephemeral SQLite). This ensures data persistence across serverless function
  invocations on Vercel. The browser MSW mock kernel remains unchanged (InMemoryDriver).

### Fixed
- **Metadata DB persistence — `saveMetaItem()` now writes to database** — The protocol
  implementation (`ObjectStackProtocolImplementation.saveMetaItem()`) now persists metadata
  to the `sys_metadata` table via `IDataEngine` in addition to the in-memory `SchemaRegistry`.
  Previously, metadata saved via `PUT /api/v1/meta/:type/:name` was lost on server restart.
  Added `loadMetaFromDb()` bootstrap method to hydrate the registry from the database on
  startup. `getMetaItem()` and `getMetaItems()` now fall back to database queries when items
  are not found in the in-memory registry. Discovery endpoint metadata status upgraded from
  `degraded` to `available`. Graceful degradation: if the database is unavailable, operations
  fall back to memory-only mode with a warning.
- **Vercel API always returns HTML — serverless function entrypoint not found** — The `bundle-api.mjs`
  script was emitting `api/index.js` at the project root, but `vercel.json` sets `outputDirectory: "dist"`,
  so Vercel could not discover the serverless function and fell back to the SPA HTML route for all
  `/api/*` requests. Changed esbuild `outfile` to `dist/api/index.js` and added explicit `functions`
  config in `vercel.json` with `@vercel/node@3` runtime.

### Added
- **Batch schema sync for remote DDL in kernel bootstrap** — `ObjectQLPlugin.syncRegisteredSchemas()`
  now groups objects by driver and uses `syncSchemasBatch()` when the driver advertises
  `supports.batchSchemaSync = true`. This reduces the number of remote DDL round-trips from
  roughly N×(2–3) individual calls (introspection + optional PRAGMA + DDL write per object)
  to a small constant number of batched `client.batch()` calls, cutting cold-start times from
  58+ seconds to under 10 seconds for 100+ objects on remote drivers (e.g. Turso cloud).
  Falls back to sequential `syncSchema()` per object for drivers without batch support or if the
  batched calls fail at runtime. Added `batchSchemaSync` capability flag to `DriverCapabilitiesSchema`,
  optional `syncSchemasBatch()` to `IDataDriver`, and `RemoteTransport.syncSchemasBatch()` using
  `@libsql/client`'s `batch()` API.
- **`@objectstack/driver-turso` — dual transport architecture** — TursoDriver now supports three
  transport modes: `local`, `replica`, and `remote`. Remote mode (`url: 'libsql://...'`) enables
  pure cloud-only queries via `@libsql/client` SDK (HTTP/WebSocket) without requiring a local
  SQLite database or Knex. Transport mode is auto-detected from the URL or can be forced via
  `config.mode`. The driver exposes `transportMode` and `isRemote` properties for runtime
  introspection. All IDataDriver methods (CRUD, bulk, transactions, schema sync) work identically
  across all modes. Added `RemoteTransport` class, `TursoTransportMode` type, and support for
  injecting a pre-configured `@libsql/client` instance via `config.client`.

### Fixed
- **Vercel deployment — `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `@objectstack/metadata`** — Fixed incorrect
  `exports` paths in `@objectstack/metadata` `package.json` that pointed directly to TypeScript
  source files (`src/index.ts`, `src/node.ts`) instead of compiled dist output. Node.js cannot
  import `.ts` files at runtime, causing `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on Vercel. Updated `main`, `types`,
  and `exports` to reference dist files (`dist/index.js`, `dist/index.mjs`, `dist/node.mjs`, etc.).
  Added a local `tsup.config.ts` with both entry points (`src/index.ts`, `src/node.ts`) and a
  `files` field to the package.json. Follows the same pattern as `@objectstack/spec`.
- **Vercel deployment — `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `@objectstack/service-feed`** — Fixed incorrect
  `exports` paths in `package.json` for all service packages that declare `"type": "module"`. When
  `tsup` builds an ESM package (`"type": "module"`), it outputs `.js` for ESM and `.cjs` for CJS.
  However, the exports maps incorrectly referenced `.mjs` (ESM) and `.js` (CJS) — the convention
  for packages *without* `"type": "module"`. This caused Node's ESM resolver to fail with
  `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` when Vercel tried to import `dist/index.mjs` (which doesn't exist).
  Affected packages: `service-feed`, `service-automation`, `service-cache`, `service-realtime`,
  `service-job`, `service-queue`, `service-storage`, `service-analytics`.
- **`@objectstack/driver-sql` DTS build failure — knex type resolution** — Fixed a TypeScript
  declaration build failure caused by knex v3.2.3 declaring a non-existent `.d.mts` types file
  in its package.json `exports` field. With `moduleResolution: "bundler"`, TypeScript could not
  resolve knex's type declarations, resulting in TS7016 and TS7006 errors during DTS generation.
  Added a `paths` mapping in the driver-sql `tsconfig.json` to direct TypeScript to the correct
  `knex/types/index.d.ts` file. This also fixes cascade build failures in all downstream
  packages that depend on driver-sql.
- **`SqlDriver.syncSchema()` — physical table name mismatch** — Fixed the root cause of the
  `no such table: sys_user` error: `syncSchema()` was ignoring the `object` parameter (physical
  table name like `sys_user`) and using `schema.name` (FQN like `sys__user`) for DDL operations.
  The method now correctly passes the physical table name to `initObjects()`. Additionally,
  `initObjects()` now supports a `tableName` property as defense-in-depth, preferring it over
  `name` when both are present.
- **Login API error — database tables not created** — Fixed a critical naming mismatch between
  the FQN (Fully Qualified Name) used by SchemaRegistry (e.g., `sys__user` with double underscore)
  and the physical table name derived by `ObjectSchema.create()` (e.g., `sys_user` with single
  underscore). `syncRegisteredSchemas()` now uses the `tableName` property from object definitions
  for DDL operations, ensuring tables are created with the correct physical name that matches
  what the auth adapter and `SystemObjectName` constants expect.
- **`SchemaRegistry.getObject()` — protocol name resolution** — Added a third fallback that
  matches objects by their `tableName` property (e.g., `getObject('sys_user')` now correctly
  finds the object registered as FQN `sys__user`). This bridges protocol-layer names
  (`SystemObjectName.USER = 'sys_user'`) with the registry's FQN naming convention.
- **`ObjectQL.resolveObjectName()` — physical table name** — Now returns `schema.tableName`
  (the physical table/collection name) instead of `schema.name` (the FQN) when available,
  ensuring driver SQL queries target the correct table.
- **`SqlDriver.ensureDatabaseExists()` — multi-driver support** — Extended database
  auto-creation to support MySQL (error code `ER_BAD_DB_ERROR` / errno 1049) alongside
  PostgreSQL (error code `3D000`). SQLite is explicitly skipped (auto-creates files).
- **`SqlDriver.createDatabase()` — MySQL support** — Added MySQL-specific logic that
  connects without a database specified and uses `CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS`.

### Added
- **`@objectstack/driver-turso` plugin** — Migrated and standardized the Turso/libSQL driver from
  `@objectql/driver-turso` into `packages/plugins/driver-turso/`. The driver **extends** `SqlDriver`
  from `@objectstack/driver-sql` — all CRUD, schema, filter, aggregation, and introspection logic
  is inherited with zero code duplication. Turso-specific features include: three connection modes
  (local file, in-memory, embedded replica), `@libsql/client` sync mechanism for embedded replicas,
  multi-tenant router with TTL-based driver caching, and enhanced capability flags (FTS5, JSON1,
  CTE, savepoints, indexes). Includes 53 unit tests. Factory function `createTursoDriver()` and
  plugin manifest for kernel integration.
- **Multi-tenant routing** (`createMultiTenantRouter`) — Database-per-tenant architecture with
  automatic driver lifecycle management, tenant ID validation, configurable TTL cache, and
  `onTenantCreate`/`onTenantEvict` lifecycle callbacks. Serverless-safe (no global intervals).

### Changed
- **`@objectstack/driver-sql` — Protected extensibility** — Changed `private` to `protected` for
  all internal properties and methods (`knex`, `config`, `jsonFields`, `booleanFields`,
  `tablesWithTimestamps`, `isSqlite`, `isPostgres`, `isMysql`, `getBuilder`, `applyFilters`,
  `applyFilterCondition`, `mapSortField`, `mapAggregateFunc`, `buildWindowFunction`,
  `createColumn`, `ensureDatabaseExists`, `createDatabase`, `isJsonField`, `formatInput`,
  `formatOutput`, `introspectColumns`, `introspectForeignKeys`, `introspectPrimaryKeys`,
  `introspectUniqueConstraints`). Enables clean subclassing for driver variants (Turso, D1, etc.)
  without code duplication.

### Fixed
- **`@objectstack/driver-sql` — `count()` returns NaN for zero results** — Fixed `count()` method
  using `||` (logical OR) instead of `??` (nullish coalescing) to read the count value. When the
  actual count was `0`, `row.count || row['count(*)']` evaluated to `Number(undefined)` = `NaN`
  because `0` is falsy. Now uses `row.count ?? row['count(*)'] ?? 0` for correct zero handling.

### Changed
- **Unified Data Driver Contract (`IDataDriver`)** — Resolved the split between `DriverInterface`
  (core, minimal ~13 methods) and `IDataDriver` (spec, comprehensive 28 methods). `IDataDriver`
  from `@objectstack/spec/contracts` is now the **single authoritative** contract for all database
  driver implementations. `DriverInterface` is retained as a deprecated type alias for backward
  compatibility. Both `@objectstack/driver-sql` and `@objectstack/driver-memory` now implement
  `IDataDriver` directly with full `DriverCapabilities` support.
- **`@objectstack/driver-sql`** — Added missing `IDataDriver` methods: `findStream`, `upsert`,
  `bulkUpdate`, `bulkDelete`, `commit`, `rollback`, `dropTable`, `explain`. Aligned `supports`
  with full `DriverCapabilities` schema. `updateMany`/`deleteMany` now return `number` (count)
  instead of `{ modifiedCount }` / `{ deletedCount }` objects. `delete` returns `boolean`.
- **`@objectstack/driver-memory`** — Aligned `supports` property with full `DriverCapabilities`
  schema (added `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `bulkCreate`, `bulkUpdate`, `bulkDelete`,
  `savepoints`, `queryCTE`, `jsonQuery`, `geospatialQuery`, `streaming`, `schemaSync`, etc.).

### Removed
- **`@objectstack/driver-sql` — Legacy query key fallbacks** — Removed support for deprecated
  query keys `filters` (use `where`), `sort` (use `orderBy`), `skip` (use `offset`), and `top`
  (use `limit`) from `find`, `updateMany`, `deleteMany`, and `count` methods. The SQL driver now
  strictly follows the `IDataDriver` / `QueryAST` protocol. All `as any` casts for legacy key
  access have been eliminated. Tests updated to use only standard `QueryAST` keys.

### Deprecated
- **`DriverInterface`** — Use `IDataDriver` from `@objectstack/spec/contracts` instead.
  `DriverInterface` remains as a type alias in both `@objectstack/spec/contracts` and
  `@objectstack/core` for backward compatibility.

### Added
- **`@objectstack/driver-sql` plugin** — Migrated the Knex-based SQL driver from `@objectql/driver-sql`
  into `packages/plugins/driver-sql/`. The driver implements the standard `DriverInterface` from
  `@objectstack/core` and imports types from `@objectstack/spec/data`. Supports PostgreSQL, MySQL,
  and SQLite (via `better-sqlite3`). Includes schema sync, introspection, aggregation, window
  functions, transactions, and full CRUD with both QueryAST and legacy filter format support.
  All 72 unit tests pass against in-memory SQLite.

### Changed
- **Migrate API layer to Hono + Vercel Node adapter** — Replaced the vestigial Next.js-style
  `api/[...path].ts` catch-all with a proper `api/index.ts` Hono entrypoint using `handle(app)`
  from `hono/vercel`. Vercel routes now use a rewrite rule (`/api/*` → `/api`) for native Hono
  routing, eliminating path-normalisation hacks and catch-all bundling pitfalls. Kernel boot
  remains lazy (cold-start only) via `ensureApp()` / `ensureKernel()` in `_kernel.ts`.

### Fixed
- **Service-analytics build error (TS6133)** — Removed unused `measure` variable in
  `native-sql-strategy.ts` that caused the DTS build to fail with `noUnusedLocals` enabled,
  blocking the entire CI build pipeline.
- **Next.js adapter test failures** — Updated 9 metadata API test assertions to match the
  current `dispatch(method, path, body, queryParams, context)` call signature used by the
  implementation. Tests were still expecting the old `dispatch(subPath, context, method, body)`
  signature.
- **Auth plugin test failures** — Fixed 2 tests in `auth-plugin.test.ts` that referenced the
  wrong `AuthManager` instance via `registerService.mock.calls`. Added `mockClear()` before
  local plugin init to ensure `mock.calls[0]` points to the correct AuthManager for the test's
  plugin instance.
- **SvelteKit adapter test failures** — Updated test mock to include `dispatch()` method and
  aligned Metadata, Data, Error handling, and toResponse test assertions with the unified
  catch-all dispatch pattern used by the implementation and all other adapters (e.g. Hono).
  Removed obsolete `handleMetadata`/`handleData` references from the mock.
- **Vercel serverless 404 fix** — The previous `api/[...path].ts` path-normalisation fix is now
  superseded by the Hono adapter migration above. The new `api/index.ts` entrypoint combined with
  Vercel rewrites (`/api/*` → `/api`) eliminates the routing ambiguity that caused 404s.
- **Kernel cold-start race condition** — `api/_kernel.ts` uses a shared boot promise so that
  concurrent cold-start requests wait for the same initialisation rather than launching
  duplicate boot sequences. Seed-data failures are treated as non-fatal, and the broker shim
  is validated after bootstrap with automatic reattachment if lost.
- **Broker-resilient metadata handler** — `HttpDispatcher.handleMetadata()` no longer requires
  a broker upfront. It tries the protocol service and ObjectQL registry first, falling back to
  the broker only when available. Serverless/lightweight setups without a full message broker
  now return proper metadata responses instead of throwing 500 errors.

### Added
- **`@objectstack/service-analytics`** — New multi-driver analytics service implementing `IAnalyticsService`.
  Uses a **Strategy Pattern** with priority-ordered chain: **P1 NativeSQLStrategy** (pushes queries as
  native SQL to Postgres/MySQL drivers), **P2 ObjectQLStrategy** (translates to ObjectQL `aggregate()` AST),
  **P3 InMemoryStrategy** (delegates to existing `MemoryAnalyticsService` for dev/test). Includes
  `CubeRegistry` for auto-discovery of cubes from manifest definitions and object schema inference,
  `AnalyticsServicePlugin` for kernel plugin lifecycle, `generateSql()` dry-run capability, and
  `queryCapabilities()` driver probing for dynamic strategy selection. 34 unit tests covering all
  strategy branches.
- **Studio system objects visibility** — Studio now auto-registers all system objects (sys_user,
  sys_role, sys_audit_log, etc.) from plugin-auth, plugin-security, and plugin-audit at kernel
  initialization. The sidebar "System" group dynamically lists all `isSystem=true` objects
  with a collapsible "System Objects" section. A filter toggle on the Data group allows
  showing/hiding system objects from the main object list.
- **ObjectSchema `namespace` property** — New optional `namespace` field on `ObjectSchema` for logical domain
  classification (e.g., `'sys'`, `'crm'`). When set, `tableName` is auto-derived as `{namespace}_{name}` by
  `ObjectSchema.create()` unless an explicit `tableName` is provided. This decouples the logical object name
  from the physical table name and enables unified routing, permissions, and discovery by domain.
- **SystemObjectName constants** — Extended with all system objects: `ORGANIZATION`, `MEMBER`, `INVITATION`,
  `TEAM`, `TEAM_MEMBER`, `API_KEY`, `TWO_FACTOR`, `ROLE`, `PERMISSION_SET`, `AUDIT_LOG` (in addition to
  existing `USER`, `SESSION`, `ACCOUNT`, `VERIFICATION`, `METADATA`).
- **plugin-auth system objects** — Added `SysOrganization`, `SysMember`, `SysInvitation`, `SysTeam`,
  `SysTeamMember`, `SysApiKey`, `SysTwoFactor` object definitions with `namespace: 'sys'`. Existing objects
  (`SysUser`, `SysSession`, `SysAccount`, `SysVerification`) migrated to use namespace convention.
- **plugin-security system objects** — Added `SysRole` and `SysPermissionSet` object definitions.
- **plugin-audit** — New plugin package with `SysAuditLog` immutable audit trail object definition.
- **StorageNameMapping.resolveTableName()** — Now supports namespace-aware auto-derivation
  (`{namespace}_{name}` fallback when no explicit `tableName` is set).

### Changed
- **ObjectFilterSchema `includeSystem` default** — Changed from `false` to `true`. Studio
  ObjectManager now includes system objects by default. Users can toggle visibility via the
  Data group filter control.
- **System object naming convention** — All system objects now use `namespace: 'sys'` with short `name`
  (e.g., `name: 'user'` instead of `name: 'sys_user'`). The `sys_` prefix is auto-derived via
  `tableName` = `{namespace}_{name}`. File naming follows `sys-{name}.object.ts` pattern.
- **plugin-auth object exports** — New canonical exports use `Sys*` prefix (e.g., `SysUser`, `SysSession`).
  Legacy `Auth*` exports are preserved as deprecated re-exports for backward compatibility.
- **sys_metadata object** — Migrated to `namespace: 'sys'`, `name: 'metadata'` convention (tableName
  auto-derived as `sys_metadata`).
- **Locale code fallback** — New `resolveLocale()` helper in `@objectstack/core` that resolves
  locale codes through a 4-step fallback chain: exact match → case-insensitive match
  (`zh-cn` → `zh-CN`) → base language match (`zh-CN` → `zh`) → variant expansion
  (`zh` → `zh-CN`). Used by `createMemoryI18n`, `HttpDispatcher.handleI18n()`, and
  `I18nServicePlugin` route handlers.
- **Auto-detection of I18nServicePlugin** — Both `DevPlugin` and CLI `serve` command now
  automatically detect `translations`/`i18n` config in the stack definition and register
  `I18nServicePlugin` from `@objectstack/service-i18n` when available. Falls back to
  the core in-memory i18n (with locale resolution) if the package is not installed.
- **Enhanced i18n diagnostics** — `AppPlugin` now emits clear warnings when:
  - Translations exist but no i18n service is registered (guides user to add the plugin).
  - Translations are loaded into a fallback/stub i18n service (recommends production plugin).
- **i18n locale fallback in REST routes** — `HttpDispatcher.handleI18n()` translations and labels
  endpoints now resolve locale codes via fallback when exact match returns empty translations.
  The response includes `requestedLocale` when a fallback was used.

### Changed
- **DevPlugin i18n stub** — Replaced the duplicate `createI18nStub()` in `DevPlugin` with
  `createMemoryI18n` from `@objectstack/core`, ensuring locale fallback works consistently
  in dev mode. DevPlugin now tries `I18nServicePlugin` before the stub when stack has translations.
- `createMemoryI18n` now uses `resolveLocale()` internally for `t()` and `getTranslations()`,
  enabling locale fallback (e.g. `zh` → `zh-CN`) without any plugin changes.
- CLI `serve` command now auto-registers `I18nServicePlugin` when config has translations/i18n,
  mirroring DevPlugin's auto-detection behavior for production environments.

### Changed
- **i18n route self-registration** — Moved i18n REST endpoint registration from `RestServer` to
  `I18nServicePlugin` (and kernel fallback). The i18n plugin now self-registers `/api/v1/i18n/*`
  routes via the `kernel:ready` hook, following the same autonomous plugin pattern used by
  `AuthPlugin`, `WorkflowPlugin`, and other service plugins. `RestServer` no longer registers or
  manages any i18n endpoints, keeping it strictly a protocol-driven gateway.
- Removed `enableI18n` flag from `RestApiConfig` schema (`rest-server.zod.ts`) — i18n endpoints
  are now controlled by the i18n service plugin's own `registerRoutes` option (default: `true`).
- Removed `registerI18nEndpoints()` method from `RestServer` class.
- `I18nServicePlugin` now accepts `registerRoutes` and `basePath` options for HTTP route control.
- i18n endpoints now work independently of `RestServer`, enabling MSW/mock test environments
  to serve i18n routes without any REST API gateway dependency.
- **Dispatcher i18n bridge routes** — `createDispatcherPlugin()` now registers i18n HTTP route
  bridges (`GET /i18n/locales`, `GET /i18n/translations/:locale`, `GET /i18n/labels/:object/:locale`)
  via `HttpDispatcher.handleI18n()`, ensuring i18n endpoints work even when only the kernel's
  memory fallback i18n is active (no explicit `I18nServicePlugin` loaded). This is consistent with
  how auth, analytics, packages, storage, and automation services are bridged.

### Added
- **i18n as core built-in service** — The i18n service is now a `core` criticality service with
  automatic in-memory fallback. When no plugin (e.g. `I18nServicePlugin`) registers an i18n service,
  the kernel auto-injects `createMemoryI18n` (in-memory Map-backed II18nService implementation)
  during `validateSystemRequirements()`. This ensures `/api/v1/i18n/*` routes and discovery always
  report i18n as available, even without `plugin-i18n` installed.
- `createMemoryI18n` fallback factory in `@objectstack/core` (packages/core/src/fallbacks/memory-i18n.ts)
  implementing `II18nService` contract with translation loading, dot-notation key resolution, parameter
  interpolation, and locale management.

### Changed
- `ServiceRequirementDef.i18n` upgraded from `'optional'` to `'core'` — kernel now warns (instead
  of silently ignoring) when no i18n service is registered, and auto-injects in-memory fallback.
- `SERVICE_CONFIG['i18n'].plugin` in `protocol.ts` corrected from `'plugin-i18n'` to `'service-i18n'`
  to match the actual `@objectstack/service-i18n` package name.
- Updated kernel-services.mdx documentation to reflect i18n as core/built-in capability.

### Fixed
- **AppPlugin getService crash on missing services** — `AppPlugin.start()` and
  `loadTranslations()` now wrap `ctx.getService()` in try/catch, since the kernel's
  `getService` throws when a service is not registered (rather than returning `undefined`).
  This was the direct cause of `plugin.app.com.example.crm failed to start` — the i18n
  service was not registered, so `getService('i18n')` threw an unhandled exception.
- **CLI serve: host config AppPlugin mis-wrap** — `serve.ts` no longer wraps a host/aggregator config
  (one that already contains instantiated plugins in its `plugins` array) with an extra `AppPlugin`.
  This prevents the `plugin.app.dev-workspace failed to start` error and eliminates duplicate plugin
  registration when running `pnpm dev`.
- **plugin-auth CJS→ESM interop** — Added `module` and `exports` fields to
  `@objectstack/plugin-auth` package.json so Node.js resolves the ESM build (`.mjs`) when using
  dynamic `import()`, eliminating the `ExperimentalWarning: CommonJS module … is loading ES Module`
  warning caused by `better-auth` being ESM-only.
- **i18n service registration & state inconsistency** — Discovery API (`getDiscoveryInfo`) now uses
  the same async `resolveService()` fallback chain that request handlers (`handleI18n`) use, ensuring
  the reported service status is always consistent with actual runtime availability.
- Discovery `locale` field is now populated from the actual i18n service (`getDefaultLocale`,
  `getLocales`) instead of being hardcoded, so clients get accurate locale information.
- Updated all framework adapters (Hono, Express, Fastify, Next.js, NestJS, Nuxt, SvelteKit),
  the dispatcher plugin, and the MSW plugin to `await` the now-async `getDiscoveryInfo()`.

### Added
- **AppPlugin i18n auto-loading** — `AppPlugin` now automatically loads translation bundles from
  app configs (`translations` array) into the kernel's i18n service during the `start` phase,
  coordinating i18n data loading across server/dev/mock environments.
- i18n service registration guide in `content/docs/guides/kernel-services.mdx` documenting
  service registration patterns, discovery consistency, and AppPlugin auto-loading behavior.
