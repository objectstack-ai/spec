# Build script for Vercel deployment of @objectstack/server.
#
# Follows the Vercel deployment pattern:
#   - api/[[...route]].js is committed to the repo (Vercel detects it pre-build)
#   - esbuild bundles server/index.ts → api/_handler.js (self-contained bundle)
#   - The committed .js wrapper re-exports from _handler.js at runtime
#   - Studio SPA is built and copied to public/ for serving the UI
#   - External dependencies installed in api/node_modules/ (no symlinks)
#
# Steps:
#   1. Build the project with turbo (includes studio)
#   2. Bundle the API serverless function (→ api/_handler.js)
#   3. Copy studio dist files to public/ for UI serving
#   4. Install external deps in api/node_modules/ (resolve pnpm symlinks)

# This builds server, studio, and the account portal.
cd ../..
pnpm turbo run build --filter=@objectstack/server --filter=@objectstack/studio --filter=@objectstack/account
cd apps/server

# 1b. Compile objectstack.config.ts → dist/objectstack.json (the metadata artifact).
# MetadataPlugin reads this file at startup in local mode. Without it the kernel
# cannot boot ("Cannot read artifact file … ENOENT").

# 2. Bundle API serverless function
node scripts/bundle-api.mjs

# 2b. Copy the artifact into api/dist/ so Vercel includes it in the function
# deployment package. The function runs with CWD=/var/task and resolves the
# artifact relative to its own directory (api/), so api/dist/objectstack.json
# maps to /var/task/apps/server/api/dist/objectstack.json at runtime.

# 3. Copy studio dist files to public/_studio/ for UI serving.
# Studio is always mounted under /_studio/ (same convention as the CLI
# static plugin). Vite builds with base: '/_studio/' so its asset URLs
# and router basepath are already correct for this mount point.

# 3b. Copy the account portal dist to public/_account/ — same pattern as
# studio. The account SPA is always built with base: '/_account/'.

# 4. Install external dependencies in api/node_modules/ (no symlinks)
# pnpm uses symlinks in node_modules/, which Vercel's serverless function
# packaging cannot handle ("invalid deployment package" error).
# We use npm to install external packages as real files next to the handler.
