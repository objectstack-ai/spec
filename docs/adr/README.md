# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for ObjectStack.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: The issue motivating this decision
- **Decision**: The change being proposed or decided
- **Consequences**: The resulting context after applying the decision

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
