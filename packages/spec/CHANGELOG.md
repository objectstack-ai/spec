### Patch Changes

- 28985f5: **Breaking Change: Strict Validation Enabled by Default**

  `defineStack()` now validates configurations by default to enforce naming conventions and catch errors early.

  **What Changed:**

  - `defineStack()` now defaults to `strict: true` (was `strict: false`)
  - Field names are now validated to ensure snake_case format
  - Object names, field types, and all schema definitions are validated

  **Migration Guide:**

  If you have existing code that violates naming conventions:

  ```typescript
  // Before (would silently accept invalid names):
  defineStack({
    manifest: {...},
    objects: [{
      name: 'my_object',
      fields: {
        firstName: { type: 'text' }  // ❌ Invalid: camelCase
      }
    }]
  });

  // After (will throw validation error):
  // Error: Field names must be lowercase snake_case

  // Fix: Use snake_case
  defineStack({
    manifest: {...},
    objects: [{
      name: 'my_object',
      fields: {
        first_name: { type: 'text' }  // ✅ Valid: snake_case
      }
    }]
  });
  ```

  **Temporary Workaround:**

  If you need to temporarily disable validation while fixing your code:

  ```typescript
  defineStack(config, { strict: false }); // Bypass validation
  ```

  **Why This Change:**

  1. **Catches Errors Early**: Invalid field names caught during development, not runtime
  2. **Enforces Conventions**: Ensures consistent snake_case naming across all projects
  3. **Prevents AI Hallucinations**: AI-generated objects must follow proper conventions
  4. **Database Compatibility**: snake_case prevents case-sensitivity issues in queries

  **Impact:**

  - Projects with properly named fields (snake_case): ✅ No changes needed
  - Projects with camelCase/PascalCase fields: ⚠️ Must update field names or use `strict: false`
