## 🏗️ Application Architecture

### Domain-Driven Design

The CRM application is organized by business domains:

```

```

## 📦 Core Objects

### Sales Domain
- **Account** - Companies and organizations
- **Contact** - People at accounts
- **Lead** - Prospective customers
- **Opportunity** - Sales deals in progress
- **Quote** - Price quotes for customers
- **Contract** - Legal agreements

### Service Domain
- **Case** - Customer support tickets
- **Task** - To-do items and activities

### Marketing Domain

## 🔧 Configuration

The application is configured in `objectstack.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineStack({
  manifest: {
    id: 'com.example.crm',
    version: '2.0.0',
    type: 'app',
    name: 'CRM App',
  },
  
  objects: [...],
  apis: [...],
  actions: [...],
  dashboards: [...],
  reports: [...],
  apps: [...],
});
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

1. **Configuration Keys (TypeScript Props):** Use `camelCase`
   - `maxLength`, `referenceFilters`, `defaultValue`

2. **Machine Names (Data Values):** Use `snake_case`
   - `account_number`, `first_name`, `close_date`

3. **Object Names:** Use `snake_case`
   - `account`, `opportunity`, `case`

4. **Field Names:** Use `snake_case`
   - `account_number`, `annual_revenue`, `is_active`

### Schema Design

Always start with Zod schemas:

```typescript
import { ObjectSchema, Field } from '@objectstack/spec/data';

export const MyObject = ObjectSchema.create({
  name: 'my_object',
  label: 'My Object',
  
  fields: {
    my_field: Field.text({
      label: 'My Field',
      required: true,
    }),
  },
});
```

### Type Safety

Use type inference from Zod schemas:

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

const MySchema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
});

type MyType = z.infer<typeof MySchema>;
```
