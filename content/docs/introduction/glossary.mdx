# Glossary

To navigate the ObjectStack ecosystem effectively, it's helpful to understand the specific vocabulary we use. While many terms are standard in computer science, some have specific nuances in our "Protocol-Driven" context.

## Core Concepts

### ObjectStack
The umbrella term for the entire suite of protocols and reference implementations. It is organized into **11 protocol namespaces** grouped into three architectural layers.

### Protocol
A specification defined with Zod schemas that describes how a system component should behave. Protocols are implementation-agnostic - they define the "what" and "how," not the specific code.

### Protocol Namespace
A logical grouping of related schemas and types. ObjectStack has 11 protocol namespaces: Data, Driver, Permission, UI, System, Auth, Kernel, Hub, AI, API, and Automation.

### Kernel
The runtime engine (Control Layer) that orchestrates all protocols, manages plugins, and enforces security policies.

---

## The Three Layers

### ObjectQL (Data Layer)
The database-agnostic data protocol. Defines objects, fields, queries, and filters. Think of it as "universal SQL" that compiles to any backend.

### ObjectUI (Presentation Layer)
The server-driven UI protocol. Defines apps, views, dashboards, and themes as JSON metadata. The renderer converts this to native components.

### ObjectOS (Control Layer)
The system protocol layer. Manages runtime, plugins, authentication, events, and automation. The "operating system" for business logic.

---

## Data & Schema

### Object
The fundamental unit of data modeling. Roughly equivalent to a "Table" in SQL or a "Collection" in NoSQL. An Object definition includes Fields, Validations, and Permissions.

### Field
A single data attribute within an Object. Has a type (text, number, lookup, etc.) and optional constraints (required, unique, etc.).

### Driver
An adapter plugin that allows ObjectQL to communicate with a specific database engine.
- Examples: `@objectstack/driver-postgres`, `@objectstack/driver-mongodb`

### AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
The intermediate representation of a query. ObjectQL parses requests into an AST before the Driver translates it into database-specific queries.

### Virtual Field
A field that doesn't exist physically in the database but is computed on the fly (e.g., calculated fields, aggregations).

---

## UI & Interaction

### View
A UI component that displays object data. Types include ListView (grid/kanban), FormView (create/edit), and specialized views (calendar, gantt).

### Widget
A reusable UI component that can be embedded in pages or dashboards. Follows the ObjectUI widget contract.

### Layout
A JSON structure that describes the visual arrangement of components. Can be nested and dynamic.

### Action
A discrete unit of logic that can be triggered by a user (button click) or system event. Defines behaviors like navigation, data updates, or API calls.

---

## Automation & Logic

### Workflow
A business process defined as a Finite State Machine (FSM). Consists of States, Transitions, and Guards. Executes when records move between states.

### Flow
A visual logic automation tool. Supports:
- **Screen Flows:** Interactive, user-driven processes
- **Autolaunched Flows:** Triggered by events
- **Scheduled Flows:** Run on a schedule

### Webhook
An HTTP callback that allows external systems to trigger actions or receive data from ObjectStack.

---

## Security & Access

### Permission Set
A collection of object-level and field-level permissions that can be assigned to users or roles.

### FLS (Field-Level Security)
Granular access control applied to individual fields (columns), not just entire objects (rows).

### OWD (Organization-Wide Defaults)
The baseline access level for records before sharing rules are applied. Can be Private, Public Read, or Public Read/Write.

### Sharing Rule
Additional access grants based on criteria (owner-based) or conditions (criteria-based). Extends access beyond OWD.

### Territory
A hierarchical access control model that grants data access based on geographic or organizational boundaries.

---

## System & Runtime

### Plugin
An extension package that adds functionality to ObjectStack. Follows the Kernel Protocol manifest specification.

### Manifest
The configuration file (`objectstack.config.ts`) that declares a plugin's metadata, dependencies, and resources.

### Event Bus
The system messaging infrastructure that enables plugins to communicate asynchronously via events.

### Job
A scheduled or queued background task managed by the System Protocol. Supports cron schedules, intervals, and one-time execution.

---

## Enterprise Features

### Space (Workspace)
A logical isolation unit for multi-tenancy. Each space has its own data, users, and configuration.

### Tenant
An organization or customer in a multi-tenant deployment. Each tenant's data is isolated using strategies like schema isolation or row-level filtering.

### Datasource
An external data connection configuration. Allows ObjectStack to query and sync with external databases or APIs.

---

## Development Terms

### TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit)
A test suite that validates if a Driver or Renderer complies with the ObjectStack Protocol. Passing the TCK certifies compatibility.

### Compiler
The component that translates high-level ObjectQL queries into optimized database-specific queries. Not a runtime wrapper like an ORM.

### Renderer
The UI component that converts ObjectUI metadata (JSON) into native interface elements (React, Flutter, etc.).

---

## Architecture Patterns

### Protocol-Driven
A development paradigm where logic is defined in declarative data formats (JSON/YAML) with Zod schemas rather than imperative code.

### Local-First
An architectural pattern where applications read/write to a local database first, with background synchronization to the cloud.

### Database Agnostic
The ability to swap database backends without changing application code. ObjectQL acts as a universal abstraction layer.

### Server-Driven UI
A pattern where the server sends UI structure as data (JSON), and the client renders it dynamically. Enables updates without app deployments.
