Connector Protocol - LEVEL 3: Enterprise Connector

Defines the standard connector specification for external system integration.

Connectors enable ObjectStack to sync data with SaaS apps, databases, file storage,

and message queues through a unified protocol.

**Positioning in 3-Layer Architecture:**

- **L1: Simple Sync** (automation/sync.zod.ts) - Business users - Sync Salesforce to Sheets

- **L2: ETL Pipeline** (automation/etl.zod.ts) - Data engineers - Aggregate 10 sources to warehouse

- **L3: Enterprise Connector** (THIS FILE) - System integrators - Full SAP integration

**SCOPE: Most comprehensive integration layer.**

Includes authentication, webhooks, rate limiting, field mapping, bidirectional sync,

retry policies, and complete lifecycle management.

This protocol supports multiple authentication strategies, bidirectional sync,

field mapping, webhooks, and comprehensive rate limiting.

Authentication is now imported from the canonical auth/config.zod.ts.

## When to Use This Layer

**Use Enterprise Connector when:**

- Building enterprise-grade connectors (e.g., Salesforce, SAP, Oracle)

- Complex OAuth2/SAML authentication required

- Bidirectional sync with field mapping and transformations

- Webhook management and rate limiting required

- Full CRUD operations and data synchronization

- Need comprehensive retry strategies and error handling

**Examples:**

- Full Salesforce integration with webhooks

- SAP ERP connector with CDC (Change Data Capture)

- Microsoft Dynamics 365 connector

**When to downgrade:**

- Simple field sync → Use [Simple Sync](../automation/sync.zod.ts)

- Data transformation only → Use [ETL Pipeline](../automation/etl.zod.ts)

@see [../automation/sync.zod.ts](../automation/sync.zod.ts) for Level 1 (simple sync)

@see [../automation/etl.zod.ts](../automation/etl.zod.ts) for Level 2 (data engineering)

## When to use Integration Connector vs. Trigger Registry?

**Use `integration/connector.zod.ts` when:**

- Building enterprise-grade connectors (e.g., Salesforce, SAP, Oracle)

- Complex OAuth2/SAML authentication required

- Bidirectional sync with field mapping and transformations

- Webhook management and rate limiting required

- Full CRUD operations and data synchronization

- Need comprehensive retry strategies and error handling

**Use `automation/trigger-registry.zod.ts` when:**

- Building simple automation triggers (e.g., "when Slack message received, create task")

- No complex authentication needed (simple API keys, basic auth)

- Lightweight, single-purpose integrations

- Quick setup with minimal configuration

@see ../../automation/trigger-registry.zod.ts for lightweight automation triggers

## TypeScript Usage

```typescript
import { ConflictResolution, Connector, ConnectorAction, ConnectorStatus, ConnectorTrigger, ConnectorType, DataSyncConfig, RateLimitStrategy, RetryConfig, RetryStrategy, SyncStrategy, WebhookConfig, WebhookEvent, WebhookSignatureAlgorithm } from '@objectstack/spec/integration';
import type { ConflictResolution, Connector, ConnectorAction, ConnectorStatus, ConnectorTrigger, ConnectorType, DataSyncConfig, RateLimitStrategy, RetryConfig, RetryStrategy, SyncStrategy, WebhookConfig, WebhookEvent, WebhookSignatureAlgorithm } from '@objectstack/spec/integration';

// Validate data
const result = ConflictResolution.parse(data);
```
