Territory Management Protocol

Defines a matrix reporting structure that exists parallel to the Role Hierarchy.

USE CASE:

- Enterprise Sales Teams (Geo-based: "EMEA", "APAC")

- Industry Verticals (Industry-based: "Healthcare", "Financial")

- Strategic Accounts (Account-based: "Strategic Accounts")

DIFFERENCE FROM ROLE:

- Role: Hierarchy of PEOPLE (Who reports to whom). Stable. HR-driven.

- Territory: Hierarchy of ACCOUNTS/REVENUE (Who owns which market). Flexible. Sales-driven.

- One User can be assigned to MANY Territories (Matrix).

- One User has only ONE Role (Tree).
