# Core Concepts

ObjectStack is built on a foundation of three revolutionary concepts that fundamentally change how we build enterprise software:

1. **Metadata-Driven Development** - Define intent, not implementation
2. **The Stack** - Three protocols working as one
3. **Universal Object Model** - A unified way to model all business data

These concepts work together to create a platform that is more flexible, maintainable, and powerful than traditional code-first approaches.

## What You'll Learn

- [Metadata-Driven](/docs/core-concepts/metadata-driven) - What is metadata-driven development?
- [The Stack](/docs/core-concepts/the-stack) - How ObjectQL + ObjectUI + ObjectOS work together
- [Object Model](/docs/core-concepts/object-model) - The Universal Object Model explained

## Why This Matters

Traditional development requires writing and maintaining code in multiple places:

- Database migrations
- Backend models and APIs
- Frontend forms and validation
- API documentation

With ObjectStack, you define your business logic **once** as metadata, and the system automatically generates:

✅ Database schema  
✅ CRUD APIs (REST/GraphQL)  
✅ Admin interface  
✅ Data validation  
✅ Access control  

## The Mental Shift

Think of ObjectStack like this:

| Traditional Approach | ObjectStack Approach |
| :--- | :--- |
| Write code for each feature | Define metadata once |
| Scattered logic across layers | Single source of truth |
| Imperative (how to do it) | Declarative (what you want) |
| Coupled to technology stack | Protocol-agnostic |

## Next Steps

Start with [Metadata-Driven](/docs/core-concepts/metadata-driven) to understand the foundation of ObjectStack's approach.
