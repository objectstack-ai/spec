# Events & Hooks

The Kernel provides a high-performance, typed Event Bus for loose coupling.

## Lifecycle Events

These events are emitted by the Kernel itself during the bootstrap process.

| Event | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `kernel:init` | The kernel has started initialization. |
| `kernel:ready` | All plugins have successfully started. System is live. |
| `kernel:shutdown` | Shutdown signal received. |

## Data Events

The Data Engine emits events for record mutations.

| Event | Payload |
| :--- | :--- |
| `data:beforeCreate` | `{ object, record }` - Can modify record or throw error to cancel. |
| `data:afterCreate` | `{ object, record, id }` - Post-processing. |
| `data:beforeUpdate` | `{ object, id, record }` |
| `data:afterUpdate` | ... |

## Usage

### Listening to Events

```typescript
ctx.hook('kernel:ready', async () => {
    ctx.logger.info("System is ready! Sending startup notification...");
});

ctx.hook('data:beforeCreate', async ({ object, record }) => {
    if (object === 'order' && record.amount > 10000) {
        ctx.logger.warn('Large order detected!');
    }
});
```

### Emitting Events

```typescript
// Custom business event
ctx.emit('order:shipped', { orderId: '123' });
```
