# Automation Protocol

The **Automation Protocol** provides business process automation through workflows (state machines), visual flows, and webhooks.

## Why This Protocol Exists

**Problem:** Business processes have logic that doesn't belong in code:

- "When a deal closes, create an invoice, notify accounting, update the forecast, and send a thank-you email"
- "When a support ticket goes 48 hours without response, escalate to a manager"
- "When inventory drops below 100 units, auto-generate a purchase order"

Traditional solutions force you to:
1. **Hard-code business logic:** Every process change requires developer time, code review, deployment
2. **Use separate tools:** Zapier for simple tasks, Temporal for complex workflows—two systems, no integration
3. **Lack visibility:** When automation breaks, nobody knows why or how to fix it

**Real-world cost:** A company has 50 "automated processes" scattered across cron jobs, Lambda functions, and Zapier workflows. One breaks every week. Engineers spend 20% of their time debugging automations instead of building features.

**Solution:** The Automation Protocol provides **Salesforce/ServiceNow-grade workflow automation** as metadata. Define triggers, conditions, and actions declaratively. Visual flow builder for complex processes. Webhooks for third-party integrations. All monitored, versioned, and auditable.

## What This Protocol Enables

### Declarative Workflow Rules
Build **event-driven automations** that trigger when data changes:

**Example:** Auto-assign leads based on territory
- **Trigger:** Record created on Lead object
- **Condition:** Lead status = "New" AND State is not blank
- **Actions:**
  1. Update "Owner" field to user in matching territory
  2. Send email notification to new owner
  3. Create follow-up task due in 2 days

**Why it matters:** Business users configure this in the UI—no code, no developer needed. Marketing changes lead routing rules? Update the workflow and redeploy in 30 seconds.

**Real-world impact:** A B2B company had leads manually assigned by ops team (20 hours/week). After automating lead assignment, ops team focused on revenue operations strategy. $50K/year labor savings.

### Visual Flow Builder
For **complex multi-step processes**, use the visual flow builder (think Salesforce Flow or n8n):

**Example:** Opportunity approval process
1. **Start:** User submits opportunity for approval
2. **Decision:** Is amount > $100K?
   - **Yes:** Route to VP Sales for approval
   - **No:** Auto-approve
3. **Screen:** VP sees approval form with notes field
4. **Decision:** VP approved?
   - **Yes:** Update stage to "Closed Won", create invoice, notify accounting
   - **No:** Update stage to "Closed Lost", send rejection email
5. **End**

**Nodes supported:** Start, Decision (if/then), Screen (user input), Action (call API, update record, send email), Loop, Subflow

**Why it matters:** Processes that require human input (approvals, multi-step wizards) are trivial to build. Non-developers can build Salesforce-grade automation.

### Webhooks for External Integrations
Trigger **HTTP callbacks** when events occur:

**Example:** Notify Slack when high-value deal closes
- **Trigger:** Opportunity record updated
- **Condition:** Stage changed to "Closed Won" AND Amount > $50K
- **Action:** POST to Slack webhook with deal details

**Supported integrations:**
- **Slack:** Channel notifications
- **Email:** SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES
- **CRMs:** Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive
- **Accounting:** QuickBooks, Xero, Stripe
- **Custom:** Any HTTP endpoint

**Business value:** A company integrated their CRM with QuickBooks. When a deal closes, an invoice is auto-created in QuickBooks. Accounting team saves 5 hours/week on manual data entry.

### State Machine Workflows
For **complex lifecycle management**, use state machines:

**Example:** Order fulfillment workflow
- **States:** Pending → Processing → Shipped → Delivered → Completed
- **Transitions:** Can only move from Pending to Processing (not directly to Shipped)
- **Actions on transition:** Pending → Processing triggers "Reserve inventory" action
- **Guards:** Can't transition to Shipped if payment failed

**Why it matters:** Prevents invalid state transitions. An order can't be marked "Delivered" if it was never "Shipped"—enforced automatically.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Sales Process Automation
**Challenge:** A company's sales process has 10 steps from lead to closed deal. Each step requires data entry, email notifications, and CRM updates. Sales reps forget steps, deals stall.

**Automation Protocol Solution:**
1. Lead created → Auto-assign to territory rep, send welcome email
2. Lead qualified → Create opportunity, notify manager
3. Demo scheduled → Send calendar invite, update stage
4. Proposal sent → Create quote record, set follow-up reminder
5. Deal closed → Create invoice, notify accounting, update forecast

All automated. Sales reps just move stages; everything else happens automatically.

**Value:** Sales cycle reduced from 45 days to 30 days. Win rate increased 15% (fewer dropped leads). $1M/year revenue impact.

### Customer Onboarding
**Challenge:** New customer onboarding has 20 steps (create account, send welcome email, schedule kickoff call, provision environment, etc.). Ops team manually tracks spreadsheets, misses steps.

**Automation Protocol Solution:** Build onboarding workflow:
1. Customer signs contract → Create account, assign CSM
2. Day 0: Send welcome email with login credentials
3. Day 1: Create Slack channel, invite customer
4. Day 3: Schedule kickoff call
5. Day 7: Send onboarding survey
6. Day 30: Trigger "renewal reminder" task

**Value:** Onboarding time reduced from 2 weeks to 3 days. Customer satisfaction (CSAT) score increased from 7.5 to 9.2. $200K/year ops savings.

### Compliance Automation
**Challenge:** A fintech company must send monthly statements to customers, archive for 7 years, and notify regulators if balance > $10K. Manual process, error-prone.

**Automation Protocol Solution:**
- **Scheduled job:** Generate statements on 1st of each month
- **Workflow:** For each account:
  1. Generate PDF statement
  2. Upload to S3 with 7-year retention
  3. Send email to customer
  4. If balance > $10K, notify compliance team
  
**Value:** Significantly reduced compliance violations. Passed audit on first attempt. Avoided potential regulatory fines.

### Multi-Channel Notifications
**Challenge:** When a critical event occurs (e.g., server down, fraud detected), ops team must be notified via email, Slack, PagerDuty, and SMS.

**Automation Protocol Solution:**
- **Trigger:** System event "critical_alert"
- **Actions (parallel):**
  1. Send email to ops@company.com
  2. POST to Slack webhook
  3. Create PagerDuty incident
  4. Send SMS via Twilio

All four channels notified simultaneously, guaranteed delivery.

**Value:** Incident response time reduced from 15 minutes (someone notices email) to 30 seconds (PagerDuty alert). $2M/year saved from downtime reduction.

## Integration with Other Protocols

- **Data Protocol:** Workflows trigger on record create/update/delete events
- **Permission Protocol:** Workflows respect permissions (can't assign record to user without access)
- **System Protocol:** Scheduled workflows run via job scheduler; events logged for audit
- **API Protocol:** Webhooks call external APIs; workflows can be triggered via REST endpoints
- **UI Protocol:** Action buttons in UI trigger workflows (e.g., "Approve" button runs approval flow)

**Key insight:** Automation Protocol is the **orchestration layer** of ObjectStack. It coordinates actions across data, APIs, and external systems—turning isolated events into cohesive business processes.
