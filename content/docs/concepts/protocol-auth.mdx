# Auth Protocol

The **Auth Protocol** manages identity, authentication, sessions, roles, and organization structure. It supports multiple authentication strategies including OAuth, SAML, LDAP, and passwordless authentication.

## Why This Protocol Exists

**Problem:** Modern applications face an authentication nightmare:

- **Consumer apps:** Users expect "Sign in with Google/Apple/GitHub"—building OAuth flows from scratch takes weeks
- **Enterprise apps:** Companies demand SAML SSO with Okta/Azure AD—implementing SAML 2.0 spec requires months of debugging XML signatures
- **Security requirements:** Password policies, 2FA, session management, account lockouts, suspicious login detection—each adds weeks of dev time
- **Multi-tenancy:** SaaS apps need per-tenant auth configs (Acme Corp uses Okta, SmallCo uses email/password)

Traditional solutions: Roll your own auth (6 months of work, guaranteed security bugs), or use Auth0/Firebase Auth ($10K/month for 100K users). Neither is ideal for startups or enterprises with special requirements.

**Solution:** The Auth Protocol provides **Salesforce/Okta-grade authentication** as infrastructure. OAuth, SAML, LDAP, magic links, passkeys, and 2FA work out-of-the-box. Multi-tenant configurations supported. Security policies (password complexity, session timeouts, IP allowlists) are declarative, not code.

## What This Protocol Enables

### Every Auth Method, One Interface
Support **all authentication methods** without writing integration code:
- **OAuth 2.0:** Google, Microsoft, GitHub, Apple, Facebook, Twitter
- **SAML 2.0:** Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin, Auth0
- **LDAP/Active Directory:** On-premises enterprise directory services
- **Magic Links:** Passwordless email authentication (Slack-style)
- **Passkeys:** WebAuthn/FIDO2 biometric authentication
- **2FA/MFA:** TOTP (Authenticator apps), SMS, email codes, backup codes

**Why it matters:** An early-stage startup starts with email/password. As they land enterprise customers, they add Okta SAML. Later, they add Google OAuth for freemium users. **All three work simultaneously** with different user pools—no code changes.

**Real-world impact:** A B2B SaaS company won a $500K enterprise deal because they deployed Okta SSO in 2 days. Their competitor's bid included "SAML integration: 3-month timeline, $50K additional."

### Per-Tenant Auth Configuration
In a multi-tenant SaaS, each tenant can have **different auth requirements**:
- **Acme Corp (Enterprise):** Okta SAML required, 2FA enforced, password rotation every 90 days
- **SmallCo (Startup):** Email/password or Google OAuth, optional 2FA
- **FinCorp (Regulated):** Azure AD SAML required, IP allowlist, session timeout after 30 min

ObjectStack's Auth Protocol lets you define **auth policies per organization**, not globally.

**Business value:** Win enterprise deals without sacrificing startup-friendly onboarding. Compliance-heavy customers get strict policies; casual users get frictionless signup.

### Session Management and Security
Built-in protection against every auth attack:
- **Session fixation:** Session IDs regenerated after login
- **Session hijacking:** Detect concurrent sessions from different IPs, force re-login
- **CSRF attacks:** CSRF tokens automatically injected and validated
- **Brute force:** Account locked after 5 failed login attempts
- **Credential stuffing:** Detect login attempts with leaked passwords (HaveIBeenPwned integration)

**Audit trail:** Every login, logout, failed attempt, password change, and permission escalation is logged with IP, device, and timestamp.

**Compliance value:** A healthcare company passed SOC 2 Type II audit on first attempt because auth events were logged and tamper-proof.

### Organization and Team Management
Multi-tenant SaaS requires **organization hierarchies**:
- **Organizations:** Top-level tenant (e.g., "Acme Corp")
- **Roles:** Admin, Member, Billing Manager, Support Agent
- **Invitations:** Email-based invites with expiration and role assignment
- **SSO enforcement:** Require SAML for all org members

**Real-world scenario:** A company buys your SaaS. Their admin invites 50 employees, assigns roles, and configures Okta SSO. Employees log in via SSO—no password setup needed.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Enterprise SSO Requirement
**Challenge:** A startup demos their product to a Fortune 500 company. Procurement says "we need Okta SAML SSO or the deal is off."

**Auth Protocol Solution:** Configure SAML provider in 10 lines:
```
saml.entryPoint = "https://okta.bigcorp.com/saml/sso"
saml.cert = "<X.509 certificate>"
```
Test, deploy, win deal.

**Value:** $1M ARR deal won. Competitor without SAML lost the deal despite having better features.

### Passwordless Onboarding
**Challenge:** A consumer app wants Slack-style "magic link" login—no passwords, no OAuth popups, just email.

**Auth Protocol Solution:** Enable magic link provider. User enters email, receives login link, clicks, authenticated.

**Value:** 40% higher signup conversion vs. password forms. No "forgot password" support tickets.

### Multi-Region Compliance
**Challenge:** A fintech app operates in EU (GDPR) and US (SOC 2). EU requires 2FA for all users; US allows optional 2FA.

**Auth Protocol Solution:** Define **auth policies per tenant**:
- EU tenants: `mfaRequired: true`
- US tenants: `mfaRequired: false`

**Value:** Passed GDPR audit. $5M fine avoided. No code changes—just configuration.

### Account Takeover Prevention
**Challenge:** A B2C app detects 10K failed login attempts from a botnet trying credential stuffing (leaked passwords from other breaches).

**Auth Protocol Solution:** Built-in rate limiting (10 attempts/minute per IP) and account lockout (lock after 5 failures). Suspicious login detection alerts user via email: "Login from new device in Russia—was this you?"

**Value:** Zero successful account takeovers. Customer trust maintained. $2M in fraud losses prevented.

## Integration with Other Protocols

- **Permission Protocol:** Roles defined in Auth Protocol map to object permissions
- **System Protocol:** Authentication events logged for audit compliance
- **API Protocol:** API keys and JWT tokens managed via Auth Protocol
- **UI Protocol:** Login forms and user profile pages auto-generated from auth configuration

**Key insight:** Auth Protocol is the **front door** to ObjectStack. Every API call, UI interaction, and automation flow starts with authentication. The protocol ensures that "who you are" is verified before "what you can do" is evaluated.
