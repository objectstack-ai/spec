# Hub Protocol

The **Hub Protocol** provides SaaS and marketplace capabilities including multi-tenancy, licensing, plugin marketplace, and deployment management.

## Why This Protocol Exists

**Problem:** Building a B2B SaaS platform requires infrastructure that has nothing to do with your product:

- **Multi-tenancy:** Isolate Customer A's data from Customer B—with database-level, schema-level, or row-level strategies
- **Usage billing:** Track API calls, storage, users to enforce quotas and generate invoices
- **Licensing:** Feature flags for "Starter vs. Enterprise" plans, trial periods, seat limits
- **Plugin marketplace:** Third-party developers want to sell integrations—you need vetting, payments, and revenue sharing
- **Deployment management:** Customers want dedicated environments (dev, staging, prod) or private cloud deployments

Building this from scratch takes 12+ months and distracts from your core product. Salesforce, Shopify, and WordPress took years to get this right.

**Solution:** The Hub Protocol provides **Salesforce-AppExchange-grade infrastructure** out of the box. Multi-tenancy, licensing, and marketplace are configuration, not code. Launch a B2B SaaS in weeks, not years.

## What This Protocol Enables

### Multi-Tenancy That Scales
Support **three isolation strategies** based on customer requirements:

**Database-level isolation:** Each tenant gets a dedicated database. Best for regulated industries (healthcare, finance) or massive customers (10M+ records). Example: Acme Corp gets `tenant_acme` database.

**Schema-level isolation:** Each tenant gets a schema in a shared database. Good balance between isolation and cost. Example: All tenants share one Postgres instance, Acme Corp uses `acme_schema`.

**Row-level isolation:** All tenants share tables; row-level security filters data by `tenant_id`. Cheapest option, great for SMB SaaS. Example: `SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE tenant_id = 'acme'` enforced automatically.

**Why it matters:** Start with row-level isolation to minimize costs. Land a Fortune 500 customer who demands database isolation? Migrate them without code changes. The Hub Protocol handles routing.

**Real-world impact:** A SaaS company with 5,000 SMB customers (row-level) and 10 enterprise customers (database-level) runs on one codebase. $200K/year infrastructure savings vs. separate deployments.

### Usage-Based Licensing
Enforce **usage quotas and feature flags** per tenant:
- **User limits:** Starter plan = 5 users, Pro plan = 50 users, Enterprise = unlimited
- **Storage limits:** 10GB on Starter, 100GB on Pro, 1TB on Enterprise
- **API rate limits:** 10K calls/month on Starter, 1M on Pro, unlimited on Enterprise
- **Feature flags:** `advanced_analytics`, `custom_branding`, `sso`, `api_access`

When a tenant exceeds their quota, the protocol **auto-blocks** further usage and prompts an upgrade.

**Business value:** Monetize power users automatically. A startup on the Starter plan hits 5-user limit? In-app prompt to upgrade to Pro. Conversion happens without sales calls.

### Plugin Marketplace
Create an **AppExchange-style marketplace** where third-party developers sell plugins:

**For platform owners:**
- Vet plugins for security/quality before publishing
- Set commission rates (e.g., 30% platform fee)
- Auto-bill customers, auto-pay developers

**For plugin developers:**
- Reach thousands of customers without building distribution
- Handle billing, licensing, and updates via the marketplace
- Example: "Shopify Sync Pro" plugin sells for $49/month, developer gets $34, platform gets $15

**For end users:**
- One-click install from marketplace
- Billing consolidated in platform subscription
- Auto-updates when developers push new versions

**Real-world impact:** Salesforce's AppExchange generates **$50B+ in ecosystem revenue**. ObjectStack's Hub Protocol enables the same model for your niche.

### Deployment Spaces
Support **multi-environment workflows** per tenant:
- **Development space:** Developers test changes without affecting production
- **Staging space:** QA tests before prod deployment
- **Production space:** Live customer data

Each space can run on different infrastructure (local laptop for dev, cloud for prod).

**Enterprise use case:** A large customer wants **dedicated infrastructure**. The Hub Protocol supports private cloud deployments where one tenant gets their own Kubernetes cluster. Same codebase, isolated infra.

## Real-World Use Cases

### SaaS Launch in 30 Days
**Challenge:** A startup wants to build a vertical SaaS for real estate agents. They need multi-tenancy, tiered pricing (Free/Pro/Enterprise), and trial periods—but have no SaaS experience.

**Hub Protocol Solution:**
- Enable row-level multi-tenancy: `isolationLevel: 'row'`
- Define pricing tiers with usage limits
- Configure 14-day free trial with auto-upgrade prompts
- Deploy

**Value:** Launched SaaS in 4 weeks. First paying customer in week 6. $50K MRR by month 12.

### Enterprise Customer with Compliance Requirements
**Challenge:** A healthcare SaaS lands a hospital network. HIPAA requires that patient data be **physically isolated** from other customers.

**Hub Protocol Solution:** Migrate the hospital to database-level isolation:
```
tenant: 'hospital_network'
isolationLevel: 'database'
dedicatedInfrastructure: true
```
Hospital gets their own database on dedicated AWS RDS instance. Audit logs prove isolation.

**Value:** Passed HIPAA audit, won $2M/year contract. Smaller customers stay on row-level isolation—no cost impact.

### Plugin Marketplace Revenue
**Challenge:** A B2B SaaS platform has 10K customers. Third-party developers want to sell integrations (Slack, Zoom, QuickBooks) but platform owner doesn't want to build them.

**Hub Protocol Solution:**
- Open plugin marketplace
- Developer uploads "QuickBooks Sync" plugin, sets price at $29/month
- Platform takes 30% commission
- Customers install with one click

**Value:** 500 customers install the plugin (500 × $29 = $14.5K/month). Platform earns $4.35K/month passive income. Developer earns $10.15K/month without building distribution.

### Multi-Region Deployment
**Challenge:** A SaaS company has EU customers who require data residency (GDPR) and US customers who need low latency.

**Hub Protocol Solution:**
- EU tenants deployed to `eu-west-1` region
- US tenants deployed to `us-east-1` region
- Same codebase, different deployment targets

**Value:** Compliant with GDPR's data residency requirements. Won $5M in EU contracts that were previously blocked by compliance.

## Integration with Other Protocols

- **Auth Protocol:** Per-tenant auth configurations (Acme uses Okta, SmallCo uses email/password)
- **Data Protocol:** Tenant isolation enforced at query level (automatic `WHERE tenant_id = ?` injection)
- **Permission Protocol:** Roles and permissions scoped per tenant
- **Kernel Protocol:** Plugins can be enabled/disabled per tenant

**Key insight:** Hub Protocol is the **business layer** of ObjectStack. While other protocols handle technical concerns (data, auth, UI), Hub Protocol handles **monetization** (licensing, usage tracking, marketplace revenue).
