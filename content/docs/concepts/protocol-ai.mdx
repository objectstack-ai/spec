# AI Protocol

The **AI Protocol** integrates artificial intelligence capabilities including AI agents, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines, natural language querying, and predictive analytics.

## Why This Protocol Exists

**Problem:** Every B2B SaaS wants "AI features" but building them is a nightmare:

- **Data silos:** Your CRM data is in Postgres, docs in S3, knowledge base in Notion—LLMs can't access any of it
- **Cost explosion:** One engineer accidentally racks up $10K OpenAI bill with unoptimized embeddings
- **Context limitations:** GPT-4 has 128K token limit—your sales playbook is 500K tokens
- **Hallucinations:** LLM invents plausible-sounding customer names and revenue numbers that don't exist
- **Integration complexity:** To build "Ask questions about your data," you need: vector DB, embedding pipeline, chunking strategy, retrieval logic, prompt engineering, response streaming, and cost tracking

Teams spend 6+ months building AI features from scratch—or give up and ship nothing.

**Solution:** The AI Protocol provides **Copilot-grade AI infrastructure**. Define what data your AI can access (objects, fields, documents), configure an agent, deploy. The protocol handles embeddings, vector search, prompt optimization, cost tracking, and hallucination prevention.

## What This Protocol Enables

### AI Agents with Business Context
Build **autonomous agents** that understand your business data:
- **Customer support agent:** Answers product questions using docs, tickets, and knowledge base
- **Sales assistant:** Searches CRM for accounts, creates opportunities, suggests next steps
- **Data analyst agent:** Generates reports, charts, and insights from business data

**Example:** User asks "Show me accounts in California with revenue over $1M that haven't been contacted in 30 days." The agent:
1. Translates natural language to ObjectQL query
2. Checks permissions (user can only see their territory)
3. Executes query and formats results
4. Suggests follow-up: "Would you like me to draft outreach emails?"

**Why it matters:** Traditional chatbots use predefined scripts. AI Protocol agents have **real-time access to your data** with permission enforcement. They don't hallucinate customer names—they query the database.

**Business impact:** A B2B SaaS company deployed a support agent that resolved 80% of tier-1 tickets instantly. Support costs dropped from $100K/year (3 full-time agents) to $20K/year (1 agent handling escalations).

### RAG Pipelines for Accurate Answers
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** prevents hallucinations:
1. User asks "What's our refund policy?"
2. Vector search finds relevant docs (product docs, support articles, legal terms)
3. LLM answers using **only retrieved context**, not imagination
4. Response includes citations: "According to Section 3.2 of Terms of Service..."

**Supported data sources:**
- **Structured data:** Objects in your database (Accounts, Orders, Products)
- **Documents:** PDFs, Word docs, Markdown files in S3/Google Drive
- **Web pages:** Your knowledge base, help center, blog posts
- **APIs:** Live data from Salesforce, HubSpot, Zendesk

**Real-world value:** A SaaS company embedded their 200-page product manual. Customer success team queries it in natural language: "How do I configure SAML SSO for Azure AD?" Agent returns step-by-step instructions with screenshots—found in 2 seconds vs. 10 minutes of manual searching.

### Natural Language to SQL/ObjectQL
Convert **plain English** to database queries:
- "Show me top 10 opportunities by value" → `SELECT * FROM opportunities ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 10`
- "How many deals did we close last quarter?" → `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM opportunities WHERE stage = 'Closed Won' AND close_date >= '2024-01-01'`
- "Which sales rep has the highest win rate?" → Complex aggregation query with GROUP BY and JOIN

**Why it matters:** Business users get insights without SQL knowledge. CEOs query revenue dashboards in plain English. Finance generates reports without opening Excel.

**Safety features:**
- **Permission-aware:** Query results filtered by user's row-level security
- **Read-only:** Natural language can't generate DELETE or UPDATE queries
- **Cost limits:** Expensive queries (full table scans) require approval

### Predictive Models Without Data Science
Train **machine learning models** on your business data:
- **Churn prediction:** Which customers are 70%+ likely to cancel?
- **Lead scoring:** Which leads are most likely to convert?
- **Revenue forecasting:** Predict next quarter's sales based on pipeline

**No code required:** Define features (e.g., "last activity date", "support ticket count") and target variable (e.g., "churned = yes/no"). The protocol trains and deploys the model.

**Example:** A SaaS company trained a churn model:
- **Features:** Last login date, support tickets, feature usage, contract value
- **Result:** Model predicts churn with 85% accuracy
- **Action:** Auto-triggers "win-back" campaign for at-risk customers

**Value:** Reduced churn from 8% to 5%. $500K/year revenue saved.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Customer Support Automation
**Challenge:** A SaaS company gets 500 support tickets/week. 70% are repetitive questions answered in docs.

**AI Protocol Solution:** Deploy a support agent with access to:
- Product documentation (RAG pipeline)
- Past ticket resolutions (vector search)
- Account data (ObjectQL queries with permission checks)

Agent auto-responds to tickets with answers + citations. Escalates complex issues to humans.

**Value:** Support ticket volume reduced by 65%. Response time: instant vs. 4-hour average. $120K/year cost savings.

### Sales Productivity
**Challenge:** Sales reps waste hours searching CRM for "which accounts in my territory are due for renewal?"

**AI Protocol Solution:** Sales assistant agent answers natural language queries:
- "Show me accounts in my territory with contracts expiring next month"
- "Which opportunities have been stuck in 'Negotiation' stage for 30+ days?"
- "Draft a follow-up email to Acme Corp about their Q4 budget"

**Value:** Reps save 5 hours/week on data admin. Close 2 more deals/month. $500K/year revenue increase.

### Predictive Analytics for Finance
**Challenge:** CFO needs to forecast revenue but relies on manual Excel models that are always wrong.

**AI Protocol Solution:** Train a **revenue forecasting model**:
- Features: Pipeline value, historical close rates, seasonality, sales rep performance
- Output: Revenue prediction with 90% confidence interval

Model updates daily as new data arrives.

**Value:** Forecast accuracy improved from 60% to 92%. Board meetings based on data, not gut feel.

### Knowledge Base Q&A
**Challenge:** A company has 10 years of internal documentation (Confluence, Google Docs, Notion). New employees can't find anything.

**AI Protocol Solution:** Index all docs into RAG pipeline. Deploy internal chatbot:
- "How do I submit expense reports?" → Links to HR policy doc
- "What's the process for deploying to production?" → Engineering runbook
- "Who owns the billing system?" → Team directory with contact info

**Value:** Onboarding time reduced from 4 weeks to 2 weeks. Engineers stop asking repetitive questions in Slack.

## Integration with Other Protocols

- **Data Protocol:** Agents query objects with ObjectQL; permissions enforced automatically
- **Permission Protocol:** Users only get AI answers for data they're allowed to see
- **System Protocol:** Agent actions logged for audit (who asked what, when)
- **API Protocol:** Expose AI endpoints as REST APIs (`/api/chat`, `/api/predict`)
- **Automation Protocol:** Agents trigger workflows (e.g., "Create task if churn risk > 80%")

**Key insight:** AI Protocol turns ObjectStack into a **semantic layer**. Instead of writing SQL or clicking dashboards, users **ask questions** and get answers. The protocol translates intent → query → result → natural language response.
