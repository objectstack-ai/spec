title: The ObjectStack Manifesto
description: The unshakable core principles that govern the ObjectStack ecosystem. The Constitution of the Post-SaaS Era.

import { ScrollText, Scale, Database, Code2 } from 'lucide-react';

ObjectStack exists to return enterprise application development to its essence: **Data**.

To maintain a healthy, decoupled, and future-proof ecosystem, we pledge to uphold the following unshakable core principles. These are not suggestions; they are the constraints that enable our freedom.

## Principle I: Protocol Neutrality

**"The Protocol is neutral. The Engine is replaceable."**

ObjectQL must not contain any logic specific to a particular language (e.g., Node.js), database (e.g., PostgreSQL), or runtime (e.g., Browser).

### The Law
*   **Spec before Engine:** Any feature must first be defined in the Specification layer (`packages/spec`) before a single line of code is written in the Engine layer. We reject the "implement first, standardize later" approach.
*   **Zero Leakage:** Implementation details (like React Hooks usage, or SQL specific syntax) must never leak into the Protocol definition.

### The Benefit
This ensures that an ObjectStack application defined today can theoretically run on:
*   A Node.js server with PostgreSQL (Today's Standard)
*   A Python server with SQLite (AI/Data Science)
*   A Rust WASM module in the browser (Local-First)

## Principle II: Mechanism over Policy

**"Give them the physics, not the simulation."**

ObjectStack provides the **Mechanisms** (The "How"):
*   *"Here is how you define a validation rule."*
*   *"Here is how you define a permission scope."*

ObjectStack never dictates the **Policy** (The "What"):
*   *It never says "Passwords must be 8 characters".*
*   *It never says "Users must belong to a Department".*

### Separation of Concerns
We cleanly separate the **Definition** from the **Execution**.

| Layer | Responsibility | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Protocol (Mechanism)** | Defines the capabilities. | `allowRead: string` (A slot for a formula) |
| **App (Policy)** | Defines the business logic. | `allowRead: "$user.role == 'admin'"` |
| **Engine (Execution)** | Enforces the logic. | Compiles formula to SQL `WHERE` clause. |

## Principle III: The Single Source of Truth

**"There is no 'Code'. There is only Schema."**

In a traditional application, the "truth" is scattered:
1.  Database Schema (`table.sql`)
2.  Backend Models (`User.ts`)
3.  Frontend Validation (`schema.zod.ts`)
4.  API Documentation (`swagger.json`)

In ObjectStack, **The Object Protocol is the only truth.**
*   The Database is a *derivative* of the Protocol.
*   The UI is a *projection* of the Protocol.
*   The API is a *consequence* of the Protocol.

If you change the Protocol, the entire system (DB, API, UI) must adapt automatically.

---

## Principle IV: Local-First by Default

**"The Cloud is a sync peer, not a master."**

We reject the notion that software must stop working when the internet connection drops.
*   **Latency is the enemy:** All interactions should be optimistic and instant (0ms).
*   **Ownership is the goal:** The user's data essentially lives on their device. The server is just a hub for backup and collaboration.
