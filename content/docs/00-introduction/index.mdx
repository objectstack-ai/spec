# Introduction to ObjectStack

ObjectStack is a **metadata-driven protocol** that transforms how we build enterprise software. Rather than writing code for every feature, you define your business logic declaratively through metadata (JSON/YAML), and the ObjectStack Kernel handles the execution.

## What is ObjectStack?

ObjectStack is a **full-stack metadata protocol** that provides:

- **ObjectQL**: A database-agnostic data layer
- **ObjectUI**: Server-driven UI rendering  
- **ObjectOS**: A plugin-based runtime kernel

Think of it as:
- **Kubernetes** for business applications
- **Terraform** for data modeling
- **GraphQL** + **React Server Components** combined into one protocol
