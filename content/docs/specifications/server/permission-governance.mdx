title: Permission Governance
description: The specification for the 3-Layer Security Model.
---

ObjectStack enforces a strict security model that cannot be bypassed by client-side code.

## 1. Profiles & Permission Sets (Functional Access)
Controls *what* a user can do.

### Permission Set
A collection of booleans and grants.
*   **Object Permissions:** `allow_read`, `allow_create`, `allow_edit`, `allow_delete`, `view_all`, `modify_all`.
*   **Field Permissions:** `read`, `edit` (per field).
*   **System Permissions:** `export_data`, `manage_users`.

### Profile
A user can only have **one** Profile (Base), but multiple Permission Sets (Extensions).

## 2. Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD)
Controls the *baseline* visibility of data.
*   **Private:** Users can only see records they own.
*   **Public Read Only:** Users can see everything, but only edit their own.
*   **Public Read/Write:** Open access.

## 3. Sharing Rules (Record Access)
Opens up access to specific subsets of data beyond the OWD.

### Criteria-Based Sharing
"Share all `Deals` where `Amount > 1M` with the `VP_Finance` role."

### Manual Sharing
Ad-hoc sharing of a single record (e.g., "Add John to the Sales Team for this deal").

## 4. Territory Management
A complex sharing model based on geometric or matrix hierarchies (e.g., "North America Sales" vs "Enterprise Sales").
