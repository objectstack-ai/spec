Automation Rules differ from Workflows in that they are typically strictly **Event-Driven** and stateless.

## 1. Triggers (Code)
Server-side scripts (TypeScript/Python) that run in the transaction transaction.

```typescript
// project.trigger.ts
export const beforeInsert = async (ctx) => {
    if (ctx.doc.amount > 10000) {
        ctx.doc.status = 'High Value';
    }
}
```

## 2. Validation Rules (No-Code)
Boolean expressions that block a save if they return `true`.
Defined in the Object Schema (`validation` property).

## 3. Auto-Response Rules
Logic for sending immediate email replies (e.g., "Thanks for your Ticket").

## 4. Assignment Rules
Logic for changing the `owner` of a record (e.g., "Round Robin" assignment for Leads).

## 5. Escalation Rules
Logic for time-based updates (e.g., "If Case not solved in 4h, notify Manager").
