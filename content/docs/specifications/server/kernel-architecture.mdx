**ObjectOS** is the "Operating System" of the stack. While ObjectQL deals with *Data*, ObjectOS deals with *Control*.

It acts as a middleware kernel that sits between the API and the Database Driver, ensuring that every data access is authenticated, authorized, and compliant with business rules.

## The Kernel Layers

### 1. The Identity Layer (Who?)
Before any logic runs, the Kernel resolves the actor.
*   **Authentication:** OIDC, SAML, or LDAP.
*   **Session Management:** Stateless JWT or Session Store.
*   **Context Injection:** Loading `userId`, `role`, and `organization` into the request context.

### 2. The Policy Layer (Can they?)
The Kernel enforces the **"Defense in Depth"** security model.
*   **Profile Check:** Does this user have license to use this App?
*   **Object Permission:** Can they `READ` the `Contract` object?
*   **Field Level Security (FLS):** Are they allowed to see `contract_value`?
*   **Sharing Rules:** Do they have access to *this specific record*?

### 3. The Logic Layer (What happens?)
This is the "Business Logic" container.
*   **Triggers:** Synchronous logic (`beforeInsert`).
*   **Flows:** Visual orchestration (`Approval Process`).
*   **Jobs:** Asynchronous tasks (`Send Email`).

### 4. The Sync Layer (Where is it?)
ObjectOS is designed for **Local-First** operation.
*   **Change Data Capture (CDC):** Tracking the "Delta" of every transaction.
*   **Replication:** Syncing these deltas to edge devices (SQLite) or data warehouses (Snowflake).
