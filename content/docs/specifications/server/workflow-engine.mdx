The Workflow Engine manages stateful business processes.

## 1. Flows
A Flow is a directed graph of steps.
*   **Screen Flow:** Interactive wizard (with UI).
*   **Auto-Launched Flow:** Background process (No UI).

## 2. Process Elements

### Logic Nodes
*   **Decision:** Branching based on variables.
*   **Loop:** Iterate over a collection.
*   **Wait:** Pause execution until a time or event.

### Data Nodes
*   **Get Records:** Query ObjectQL.
*   **Create/Update Records:** Mutate ObjectQL.

### Interaction Nodes
*   **Screen:** Render a form (in Screen Flows).
*   **Action:** Call an Email, Slack, or Apex Action.

## 3. State Management
The Engine persists the state of every running flow instance, allowing for "Long-Running" processes that can pause for days (e.g., waiting for Approval).
