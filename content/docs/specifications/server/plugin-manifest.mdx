description: The Standard for Extending the Kernel with Packages.
---

ObjectStack is modular. The core kernel is minimal; everything else is a **Package**.

## 1. The Package Protocol
Configured via `package.service.yml`.

```yaml
name: @steedos/crm
version: 1.2.0
dependencies:
  - @steedos/core
objects:
  - src/objects/*.object.yml
  - src/objects/leads/*.object.yml
triggers:
  - src/triggers/*.trigger.ts
```

## 2. Metadata Deployment
The Kernel supports a "Deploy" operation which takes a zipped package and applies it to the running instance idempotently.
*   **Diffing:** Only changes are applied.
*   **Destructive Changes:** Explicit `destructiveChanges.xml` required to delete metadata.

## 3. Dependency Management
Packages can depend on other packages. The Kernel enforces version compatibility and load order.
