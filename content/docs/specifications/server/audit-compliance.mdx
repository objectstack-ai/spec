For enterprise software, "Who did what and when" is non-negotiable.

## 1. Field History Tracking
Configured per-field in the Object Schema.
*   **Track Old/New:** Records the previous and new value.
*   **Retention:** Definitions for how long to keep history (e.g., "10 Years").

## 2. Setup Audit Trail
Logs all changes to **Metadata** (Schema).
*   "User A changed the validation rule on Project."
*   "User B deleted the 'Salary' field."

## 3. Login History
Logs every authentication attempt.
*   **Context:** IP Address, Browser, Location, Status (Success/Fail).

## 4. System Log
Debug logs for developers (Triggers, Flows).
