Reports in ObjectStack are just another type of View.

## 1. Report Definitions
Defined in JSON/YAML, similar to Objects.

```yaml
type: report
dataset: opportunity_analysis
chart:
  type: bar
  x_axis: close_date
  y_axis: amount
table:
  columns: [name, account, amount, stage]
  grouping: [account]
```

## 2. Dashboard Layout
A Dashboard is a page containing multiple Report Widgets.
Reference `Layout System` for grid structure.
