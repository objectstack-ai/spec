description: Understanding the flexible grid and region-based layout engine of ObjectUI.
---

ObjectUI uses a responsive, region-based layout system that adapts to screen size.

## 1. Page Templates
Top-level structures that define the macro-layout.

### Standard Template
*   **Header:** Title, Actions, Highlights.
*   **Main:** The primary content.
*   **Sidebar:** Secondary widgets.

### Console Template
Optimized for high-density work.
*   **Split View:** List on left, Detail on right.
*   **Sub-tabs:** Multiple records open at once.

## 2. Flex Grid
Within a region, components are arranged using a 12-column grid system.

```json
{
  "type": "grid",
  "columns": 2,
  "children": [
    { "span": 1, "component": "field_name" },
    { "span": 1, "component": "field_status" }
  ]
}
```

## 3. Responsive Rules
Procotol allows defining visibility rules based on device type.

*   `formFactor: "Large"` (Desktop)
*   `formFactor: "Small"` (Mobile)
