A "View" in ObjectStack is a preset configuration for displaying data.

## 1. List Views

```yaml

name: all_active
object: project
label: All Active Projects
filter:
  - ["status", "=", "Active"]
columns:
  - name
  - manager
  - due_date
  - status
sort: due_date desc
```

## 2. Form Views
Defines the layout for creating or editing a single record.

### Modes
*   **Edit:** Standard input form.
*   **Read:** Read-only detail view.
*   **Create:** Simplified creation wizard.

## 3. Related Lists
Embeds a List View of child records inside a parent record's Detail View.

```yaml

  columns: [subject, priority, status]
```
