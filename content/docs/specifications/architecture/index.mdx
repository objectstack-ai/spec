# Architecture

The ObjectStack Protocol is built on three core layers that work together to provide a complete metadata-driven platform.

## Core Layers

### [Data Layer (ObjectQL)](../../specifications/architecture/data-layer)
The Data Layer defines the "Shape of Data" and business logic. It includes:
- **Schema**: Objects and Fields with 23+ field types
- **Logic**: Workflows, Triggers, Validation Rules, Formulas
- **Security**: Permissions and Sharing Rules
- **Query**: Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for unified data access

### [UI Layer (ObjectUI)](../../specifications/architecture/ui-layer)
The UI Layer defines the "Shape of Interaction" for rendering interfaces:
- **Views**: Grid, Kanban, Calendar, Gantt, List configurations
- **Pages**: FlexiPage layouts with regions and components
- **Navigation**: App menus and navigation structures
- **Analytics**: Reports and Dashboards with widgets

### [System Layer (ObjectOS)](../../specifications/architecture/system-layer)
The System Layer defines the "Runtime Environment":
- **Manifest**: Application packaging
- **Identity**: Authentication, Roles, Licenses
- **Integration**: Webhooks, API contracts, ETL Mappings
- **Datasource**: Driver definitions for SQL, NoSQL, SaaS connectors

## Design Principles

1. **Data as Code**: All configurations are expressed as declarative metadata
2. **Intent over Implementation**: Describe what you want, not how to build it
3. **Local-First**: Works offline, syncs when connected
4. **Driver Agnostic**: Abstract away storage implementation details
