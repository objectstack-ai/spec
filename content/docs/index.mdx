**ObjectStack Protocol** is the "DNA" and constitution of the ObjectStack platform. It defines the metadata standards, schemas, and runtime behaviors that power a metadata-driven, low-code operating system.

<Callout type="info">
  This specification serves as the Single Source of Truth for all ObjectStack implementations. All definitions are strictly typed using Zod and TypeScript.
</Callout>

## The Metamodel Architecture

The protocol is divided into three fundamental pillars that decouple data, presentation, and system configuration.

## Core Principles

### 1. Schema First
Every protocol definition starts with a **Zod Schema**. This ensures runtime validation for the CLI and strict type derivation (`z.infer<T>`) for the IDE. We do not write code without a schema.

### 2. Configuration as Code
All business logic is expressed as serializable JSON/YAML configuration. This enables:
- **Version Control**: Git-based history for business logic.
- **Reviewability**: Pull requests for application changes.
- **Portability**: Move applications between environments instantly.

### 3. Separation of Concerns
We strictly separate the **Metamodel** (pure definitions) from the **Runtime** (execution engine). The `spec` package contains *only* definitions, constants, and types—no heavy business logic.

## Directory Structure

The specification is organized reflecting the protocol pillars:

- **`src/data/`**: ObjectQL definitions (Object, Field, Validation).
- **`src/ui/`**: ObjectUI definitions (App, View, Action).
- **`src/system/`**: ObjectOS definitions (Manifest, Config).
