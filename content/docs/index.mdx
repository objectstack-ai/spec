**ObjectStack** is not just a framework; it is a **Protocol** for building enterprise software. 
It decouples the *Business Intent* (defined in JSON/YAML) from the *Technical Execution* (handled by the Kernel).

This documentation is the authoritative reference for the ObjectStack Protocol.

## The "Trinity" Architecture

ObjectStack is built on five core modules that work in unison:

| Module | Protocol | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Layer** | **[ObjectQL](/docs/specifications/data/architecture)** | Defines the shape of data (`Object`, `Field`) and how to access it (`Query AST`). Agnostic to SQL/NoSQL. |
| **UI Layer** | **[ObjectUI](/docs/specifications/ui/sdui-protocol)** | The Projection. Defines User Interfaces as abstract JSON layouts (Views, Dashboards, Actions). |
| **Control Layer** | **[ObjectOS](/docs/specifications/server/kernel-architecture)** | The Kernel. Handles Identity, Security, Sync, and Automation. |
| **AI Layer** | **AI Protocol** | AI agent definitions, tools, knowledge bases, and model configurations. |
| **API Layer** | **API Protocol** | Standardized REST/GraphQL contracts with request/response envelopes. |

## For whom is this?

*   **Platform Architects:** Who want to build internal developer platforms (IDP) that scale.
*   **Protocol Implementers:** Who want to write a new Driver for ObjectQL (e.g., for FoundationDB) or a new Renderer for ObjectUI (e.g., for Flutter).
*   **AI Agent Developers:** Who need a deterministic, structured generic language for AI to generate software.
*   **Low-Code Builders:** Who want a powerful metadata-driven platform for rapid application development.
